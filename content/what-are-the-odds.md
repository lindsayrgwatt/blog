It's a screen shot from GMail of my buddy and I emailing each other.  Randomly, we both happened to email each other at almost exactly the same time to see if the other wanted to go see a movie.  Kind of a bizarre "[Shining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film))" thing going on.  Would love to know the odds of something like this.
