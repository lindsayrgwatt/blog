So the other weekend I cashed in all my loose change.  I had three coffee containers full - which ended up working out to be a little over $300!  I used a coin sorting machine that gave me an Amazon gift certificate, and that's now led to the following:

That's 17 books so I think I'm good from now to the end of the year (if only because I'll be trying to figure out how any publisher can make money when I can get this many books delivered to me via UPS for so little).

On a related note, this shopping experience completely confirmed why [Amazon is](http://www.skrenta.com/2008/02/amazon_is_the_google_of_buying.html) *[the](http://www.skrenta.com/2008/02/amazon_is_the_google_of_buying.html)*[ platform for buying things](http://www.skrenta.com/2008/02/amazon_is_the_google_of_buying.html).  Every single one of these books was part of my wishlist (some for a few years).  Amazon never asked me to update my wishlist, rather just kept it there for the day when I was finally ready.

Also, now that I've bought the books they don't appear in my wishlist and if I go to the page for any of the books there's a gentle reminder that I've already bought it:

If that's not the ultimate retail experience, then I don't know what is.
