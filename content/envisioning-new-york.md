Today I went out to Flushing with my buddy Rich to get some great dumplings/Szechuan food (that's another post).  On the way back, I made him stop at the [Queens Museum of Art](http://www.queensmuseum.org/index.htm) to see the [Panorama of New York](http://www.queensmuseum.org/panorama/about.htm).  For those who have no idea, the Panorama is a life-size, 100% accurate replica of every single building in the five boroughs as of 1992 (It was originally built for the 1964 World's Fair).

It was really cool to see, but I couldn't help but think of how archaic it is and how every single thing it does is now available on my phone or computer.

Here's a shot of the lower Manhattan portion:

Here's how the same scene renders in Google Earth:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/06/picture-1-300x221.png" title="Lower Manhattan - Google Earth" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="221" alt="Lower Manhattan - Google Earth" />

It's almost identical-except that the Google edition is constantly up to date, lets me zoom and has info added to highlight places of potential interest.

Similarly, here's a photo of both the panorama and the same location in Google Maps on my iPhone:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/06/img_8722-300x200.jpg" title="Google Maps vs. Panorama of NYC" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="200" alt="Google Maps vs. Panorama of NYC" />

I've now got the Panorama to go.

In fact, I can now do things on my phone that the Panorama will never be able to do: [UpNext](http://www.upnext.com/iphone/) allows me to see individual building across Manhattan in 3D.  The [Old Map App](http://oldmapapp.com/) actually lets me watch the same point evolve through time (whereas the Panorama has only been updated twice: 1964 and 1992).

Interestingly, the Museum is now trying to make the Panorama a little more interactive: they've placed pink triangles on all locations (outside Manhattan) where 3 or more foreclosures have happened.  Note the swath from Bed-Stuy to Jamaica via East New York:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/06/img_8709-300x200.jpg" title="Foreclosures in NYC - Panorama of NYC" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="200" alt="Foreclosures in NYC - Panorama of NYC" />

Of course, this is also a totally outmoded way to do this.  The New York Times' [foreclosure map](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/05/15/nyregion/0515-foreclose.html) makes in a lot easier to visualize.

The Panorama is well worth seeing if you ever come to NYC - and seeing the model is a million times more impressive that looking at an image on a screen.  It's just incredible to think that you can now take it with you everywhere you go.
