I gave a talk today at ProductCamp Vancouver (well done organizers!) called Articulating Your Idea. It's a 12 step process for taking your thoughts/visions and turning them into one or two concrete sentences that people can understand.

Here's a link to the slides:

On a different note, the event was in the SFU Business School, whose building is the old BMO building at Granville & Pender. It's a beautiful place and I highly recommend going in it if you're in the area (and check out the old vault doors in the basement).
