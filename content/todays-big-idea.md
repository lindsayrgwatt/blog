There are big ideas and then there are big ideas.  Reading this [blog entry on Ford's electric vehicles](http://greenmonk.net/fords-thinking-on-electric-vehicles/) is mind expanding.  Imagine an America with lots of electric cars.  Now imagine a smart electric grid with variable pricing.  Your car charges at night (when power cheap and interestingly most winds are strong enough).  During the day, if it's plugged in, it's putting energy back into the grid - and you're pocketing the difference.  That's a huge idea.
