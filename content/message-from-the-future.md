Last week daylight savings time began. One of the small pleasures of the 21st century is that you never have to worry about getting up an hour too early/late on these days because you can use your cellphone as your alarm clock. Their clocks update automatically, so you've effectively outsourced the problem to them.

However, it's interesting to see that their systems don't always work. Last week I missed a call and when I checked my voicemail, the message was from the future (Just another example of AT&T's network failing!):
