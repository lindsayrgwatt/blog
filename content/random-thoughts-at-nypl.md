I spent part of Saturday working at the NYPL branch on 5th & 42nd (it's *the* best place to get a desk to work at in the entire city).  Here are a couple of ramblings:

- In the morning, the reading hall was filled with tourists and people working with Mac computers.  By mid-afternoon there were no more tourists and lots of people using PCs
- The library has a massive room (100' x 30' with 20' ceilings) that contains exactly one book - but what a book - a [Gutenberg bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible):
- <img src="{static}/images/2009/04/img_0025-300x225.jpg" title="Gutenberg Bible" class="alignleft size-medium " width="300" height="225" alt="Gutenberg Bible" />
- In that room the walls are covered by paintings of long-dead Americans, with the exception fo a corner where there are four landscape paintings. One is of the library itself and two are of random American scenes. However, the third is out of left field: it's a [Krieghoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Krieghoff) of Quebec City circa 1850
