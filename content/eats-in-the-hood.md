I'm still struggling with the jet lag today, so I went for a walk at lunch for some fresh air. I was pleasantly surprised to find a great new restaurant in the neighbourhood - [The Simple Kitchen Organic Cafe](http://simplekitchenco.com/). Despite it's rather complex moniker, the place is likely to become a regular stop for me on my daily search for take out food.

There's a hint of the unknown to the place: the windows were completely steamed up when I saw it and you could not see anything inside. However, opening the door led to an outpouring of nuanced smells as the soups/salads/curries inside collided with some of the flowers decorating the place:

The ultimate test of any restaurant is the food, and it did not disappoint. I ordered chicken kebabs with couscous and roast vegetables and it was one of the best lunches I've had in ages:

They get bonus points for preparing the food for take-out but then reheating it while you're paying. They use a proper oven and it leaves the meat looking as though it was just cooked, and slightly charbroiled.

If you're in the 'hood let me know, and we'll swing by.
