A friend of mine recently sent me a link to a [set of vintage cocktail books](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/?fbclid=IwAR3wMU4-p4svgjB2k08yO3wCkWgTSu96_ZpZzapKq0jZwP0Zv9Ibw9fuDnQ). I wanted to trace the history of the Manhattan because it is easily my favorite drink.





[Wikipedia suggests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(cocktail)#Origin_and_history.) the drink may have been invented as early as 1860. However, there's no mention of the Manhattan in early cocktail manuals like 1864's "[The Bartender's Guide](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1864-Bar-Tender-s-Guide-price-2-00-by-Jerry-Thomas)", 1867 [The American Barkeeper](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1867-The-American-Barkeeper-by-a-Practical-Liquor-Manufacturer), 1876's [Bar-tender's Guide or How to Mix Drinks](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1876-Jerry-Thoma-s-Bar-Tender-s-Guide-or-How-to-Mix-Drinks-Soft-Cover) or either the [1878](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1878-American-and-other-drinks) or [1881](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1881-American-and-Other-Drinks-second-edition-Hard-cover-by-Leo-Engel) edition of American & Other Drinks.





There's no mention of it in 1884's "[The Complete Bartender: The Art of Mixing](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1884-The-complete-bartender-Art-of-Mixing-Plain-and-Fancy-Drinks1)." In fact, many of the drinks in the book look downright terrible but the frontispiece is fantastic:

</figure>





However, 1884 is the first mention of the Manhattan that I can find. It comes in on page 21 of "[The Modern Bartender's Guide](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1884-The-Modern-Bartenders-Guide-by-O-H-Byron)" by O. H. Byron. Note that there are two recipes; one for sweet and one for dry vermouth (this will continue for a few decades):





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-10.30.57-PM-1024x802.png" class="" />
</figure>





There's a further recipe a few years laterin 1888's "[Harry Johnson's New and Improved Bartender's Manual](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1888-Harry-Johnson-s-new-and-improved-bartender-s-manual-1888)". Here it is on page 40 with the comment "This drink is very popular at the present day." Note as well that the recipe wasn't in the [1882 version](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1882-Harry-Johnson-s-new-and-improved-bartender-s-manual-1882).





<figure class=" size-large">

</figure>





Not only was Harry an author and a bartender, he also had an incredible mustache:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.07.53-PM-1024x752.png" class="" />
</figure>





1888 also saw the publication of [The Bartender's Manual](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1888-Bartender-s-Manual-by-Theodore-Proulx-Revised-Edition/IV/) which contains one of the least usable drink instructions of all time when it comes to making a Manhattan:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.11.01-PM-1024x733.png" class="" />
</figure>





For reference, here are the instructions for a whisky cocktail:





<figure class=" size-large is-resized">

</figure>





The only real difference with Harry's is that Theodore is using a squirt of lemon essence.





1888 also has the first drawing of a Manhattan in "[The Police Gazette's Bartenders Guide](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1888-The-Police-Gazette-Bartenders-Guide-by-Richard-K-Fox)" by Richard K. Fox:





<figure class=" size-large">

</figure>





This would be quite a strange drink: a "pony" is 1 oz. and a "wine-glass" could easily be 5 oz ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/14/size-does-matter-wine-glasses-are-seven-times-larger-than-they-used-to-be)). And why does this drink need to be shaken?





1895 saw the publication of "[The Mixologist](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1895-The-Mixicologist-First-Edition-by-C-F-Lawlor)" by CF Lawlor. Over 7 years, cherry had been introduced into the cocktail:

<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.17.06-PM-1024x774.png" class="" />
</figure>





The introduction to the manual also perfectly captures the spirit of the age:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.18.22-PM-766x1024.png" class="" />
</figure>





In 1896, the Manhattan has crossed the ocean to Britain and appears in "[Drinks of all Kinds for all Seasons](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1896-Drinks-of-All-Kinds-For-All-Seasons-by-Frederick-and-Seymour-Davies)" by Frederick and Seymour Davies. Note the incredible amounts of simple syrup and the first mention of Angostura bitters. Also, the first garnish: lemon:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.20.23-PM-1024x764.png" class="" />
</figure>





The 1900 edition of "[Harry Johnson's](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1900-Harry-Johnson-s-New-and-Improved-Bartenders-Manual1)" has an updated recipe (fun fact: no updated drawing of Harry; still has the epic mustache). Now there's some lemon and the option of sweet or dry vermouth. Still very popular at present day.





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.24.39-PM-1024x737.png" class="" />
</figure>





1902's "[Recipes of American and other Iced Drinks](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1902-Recipes-of-American-and-other-Iced-Drinks-by-Charlie-Paul)" by Charlie Paul has a bizarre definition of the Manhattan. Less bitters than 1896's version but Scotch as the base (perhaps because the book was published in England?):





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.28.32-PM-1024x794.png" class="" />
</figure>





1903's "[The Complete Buffet Guide or How to mix all Kinds of Drinks](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1903-The-Complete-Buffet-Guide-or-How-to-Mix-All-Kinds-of-Drinks-by-V-B-Lewis)" by V.B. Lewis builds off of Harry Johnson's latest and offers two takes on the Manhattan, alternating sweet (Italian) vs. dry (French) vermouth:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.31.31-PM-1024x813.png" class="" />
</figure>





By 1910 - and the [Jack's Manual](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1910-Jack-s-manual-on-the-vintage-and-production-care-and-handling-of-wines-liquors-etc-1910) by the eponymous J. A. Grohusko - the Manhattan is exclusively a drink made with sweet vermouth. This is also the first time the type of whisky is mentioned - rye:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.35.31-PM-1024x809.png" class="" />
</figure>





But dry vermouth still rears its ugly head seven years later in 1917's "[Seventy Recipes for Cocktails, Cups and Punches](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1917-Seventy-Recipes-for-Cocktails-Cups-and-Punches-by-GGD-and-EEFP)" where the Manhattan is known as the "Dry Manhattan Cocktail" (and I checked the index; there was no 'wet' version):





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.37.51-PM-1024x664.png" class="" />
</figure>





The Parisian version of the Manhattan appears in 1929's "[Cocktails de Paris](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1929-Cocktails-de-Paris)". The ratio of whisky to vermouth is looking more reasonable; note the Cointreau.





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.42.38-PM-1024x671.png" class="" />
</figure>





The "[Savoy Cocktail Book"](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1930-The-Savoy-Cocktail-Book) from 1930 offers up two version of the Manhattan, offering gum syrup for a sweetened version. Interestingly, the second version of cocktail is much more like the one that survives today.





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-10.53.14-PM-1024x816.png" class="" />

It's worth flipping through the book in its entirety. The design is absolutely beautiful (unfortunately [original color copies are prohibitively expensive](https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?cm_sp=plpafe-_-coll-_-first&an=craddock%20harry&fe=on&sortby=100&tn=savoy%20cocktail%20book)). Here's a sample of what you'll see:





<figure class=" size-large">

</figure>





The 1933 [Jack's Manual](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1933-Jack-s-Manual-by-J-A-Grohusko) has switched to Angostura bitters, likely as [Bokers closed during Prohibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boker%27s_Bitters):





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.46.29-PM-1024x760.png" class="" />
</figure>





1937's "[Liquid Gems](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1937-Liquid-Gems-a-book-of-Drinks-for-the-Fastiduous-Drinker)" by John R. Iverson has more whisky than sweet vermouth - but suggests bourbon instead of rye. And this is the first mention of a cherry decoration.





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-9.50.29-PM-1024x684.png" class="" />
</figure>





By 1946 and "[The Roving Bartender](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1946-The-Rowing-Bartender-by-Bill-Kelly)" by Bill Kelly, the Manhattan has an extremely fancy garnish: both lemon and a cherry. Also agnostic to rye or bourbon:





<figure class=" size-large">

The Manhattan Recipe in 1954's "[Practical Bar Management](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1954-Practical-Bar-Management-by-Eddie-Clarke)" by [Eddie Clarke](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/3010/people/eddie-clarke) (a legend from the Savoy) looks almost identical to what you'd get today:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-01-at-10.01.12-PM-1024x807.png" class="" />

Check out Eddie's skills; wish I could have had a drink at his bar:

By 1967, the Manhattan hasn't changed and is enshrined in it's current form. But, there is now a *throwback* "old fashioned" Manhattan to be found in "[Cocktails and Mixed Drinks](https://euvs-vintage-cocktail-books.cld.bz/1967-Cocktails-and-Mixed-Drinks-by-Charles-A-Tuck)" by Charles A Tuck. Harry Johnson would recognize this one.

</figure>





I personally go with the Manhattan recipe from the [Death & Co Modern Classic Cocktails book](https://www.deathandcompanymarket.com/products/autographed-death-co-book) - albeit in a rocks glass rather than in a coupe:





<figure class=" size-large">
<img src="{static}/images/2023/01/IMG_0664-1024x627.jpeg" class="" />
</figure>





Here's the final result; now I need to go back in time and try the Harry Johnson version.
