So in a few months I'll be moving to Canada. And renting. For a long time. Possibly until I'm 40. And I'm not ashamed of it.

Given that so many people consider owning a house a measure of their identity and worth, why am I not interested in buying one?

Basically I think Canada's real estate market is in a bubble and I don't know how long I'll be in Canada (at least five years, but past that, who knows) nor do I know when the market will burst. So, I won't be buying.

Now, here's a [whimsical reason why I think it's a bubble](http://www.crackshackormansion.com/). And here's the graph ([plus explanation](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/04/jeremy-grantham-on-bubbles.html)) that underlines the whimsy:

Two caveats: if the bubble bursts or I strike it rich I might buy a house. Otherwise, you'll find me in my condo...
