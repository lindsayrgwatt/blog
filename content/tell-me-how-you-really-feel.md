One thing about New Yorkers: they're not ashamed to tell you what they're thinking.

On Tuesday night I was at a movie and afterward their was an interview with the director. The interviewer wrapped it up by explaining that everyone was invited to a nearby bar where, "at midnight, to celebrate my birthday, I'll do a body shot off of my pregnant wife's belly." Truly inspiring.

The next night I was at a concert where the singer was performing a Beatles tune. She sang the phrase "the wind is high" and then ad libbed "just like my daddy." Once again, from nowhere comes more than I arguably needed to know.

It's so refreshing to live in a city where people just throw it out there and frankly don't give a sh!t what other people think...
