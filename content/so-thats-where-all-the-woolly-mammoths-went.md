As a kid I was fascinated by the fact that back in the day there used to be woolly mammoths, sabertooth tigers, milodons, etc. roaming across the plains.  I mean, what sort of six year old boy couldn't love something like this:

For the uninitiated, that's a sabertooth tiger a.k.a. a Smilodon taking down a sloth while a woolly mammoth looks on.

I'd always wondered what happened to all these animals.  I'd read that the [Younger Dryas ice age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas) came along and killed most of them off and the remaining few were killed off by early man.

But now there's a new theory!  Apparently not only was there an ice age, but then a comet came and slammed into Earth at the same time (talk about bad luck; glad I wasn't around then).  The good news was that [diamonds rained from the sky](http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20080707/sc_livescience/diamondsraineddownduringiceage;_ylt=AvtdrvlHHWaGMpL27QaiqFys0NUE).  The bad news was that the impact of the comet set everything on fire, even the air and definitely anybody within a couple of thousand kilometers of the impact site.  Oh yeah, and there were likely floods caused by the sudden melting of glaciers.
