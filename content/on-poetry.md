Over Christmas I had the chance to grab coffee with [my most literary of friends](http://twitter.com/#!/querenciazine) and we got to talking poetry. Specifically, my lack of knowledge about it due to a high school curriculum that consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare's poorer plays and witless rhyming couplets.

I said that I'm willing to give it a second chance, but that I had absolutely no idea where to begin. This led to a slew of recommendations that I've decided to share with the interpipes community.

So here, without further ado, is a selection of recommended poems. Before sharing them though, a note on how to read them. JB recommends the following three rules to get the most out of each poem:

1.  Read them out loud
2.  Read slowly
3.  Follow the punctuation, not the line breaks. If there's a line break, don't stop: keep going until the next comma or period

Here are the poems:

# [Philip Larkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Larkin)

## High Windows

When I see a couple of kids

And guess he's fucking her and she's

Taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,

I know this is paradise

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives--

Bonds and gestures pushed to one side

Like an outdated combine harvester,

And everyone young going down the long slide

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

To happiness, endlessly. I wonder if

Anyone looked at me, forty years back,

And thought, That'll be the life;

No God any more, or sweating in the dark

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

About hell and that, or having to hide

What you think of the priest. He

And his lot will all go down the long slide

Like free bloody birds. And immediately

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Rather than words comes the thought of high windows:

The sun-comprehending glass,

And beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows

Nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.

## Sad Steps

Groping back to bed after a piss

I part thick curtains, and am startled by

The rapid clouds, the moon's cleanliness.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Four o'clock: wedge-shadowed gardens lie

Under a cavernous, a wind-picked sky.

There's something laughable about this,

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

The way the moon dashes through clouds that blow

Loosely as cannon-smoke to stand apart

(Stone-coloured light sharpening the roofs below)

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

High and preposterous and separate -

Lozenge of love! Medallion of art!

O wolves of memory! Immensements! No,

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

One shivers slightly, looking up there.

The hardness and the brightness and the plain

Far-reaching singleness of that wide stare

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Is a reminder of the strength and pain

Of being young; that it can't come again,

But is for others undiminished somewhere.

## Toads

Why should I let the toad work

  Squat on my life?

Can't I use my wit as a pitchfork

  And drive the brute off?

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Six days of the week it soils

  With its sickening poison -

Just for paying a few bills!

  That's out of proportion.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Lots of folk live on their wits:

  Lecturers, lispers,

Losels, loblolly-men, louts-

  They don't end as paupers;

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Lots of folk live up lanes

  With fires in a bucket,

Eat windfalls and tinned sardines-

  they seem to like it.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Their nippers have got bare feet,

  Their unspeakable wives

Are skinny as whippets - and yet

  No one actually starves.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Ah, were I courageous enough

  To shout Stuff your pension!

But I know, all too well, that's the stuff

  That dreams are made on:

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

For something sufficiently toad-like

  Squats in me, too;

Its hunkers are heavy as hard luck,

  And cold as snow,

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

And will never allow me to blarney

  My way of getting

The fame and the girl and the money

  All at one sitting.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

I don't say, one bodies the other

  One's spiritual truth;

But I do say it's hard to lose either,

  When you have both.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

## Annus Mirabilis

Sexual intercourse began

In nineteen sixty-three

(which was rather late for me) -

Between the end of the Chatterley ban

And the Beatles' first LP.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Up to then there'd only been

A sort of bargaining,

A wrangle for the ring,

A shame that started at sixteen

And spread to everything.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Then all at once the quarrel sank:

Everyone felt the same,

And every life became

A brilliant breaking of the bank,

A quite unlosable game.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

So life was never better than

In nineteen sixty-three

(Though just too late for me) -

Between the end of the Chatterley ban

And the Beatles' first LP.

## I Shall Forget You Presently, My Dear

I shall forget you presently, my dear,

So make the most of this, your little day,

Your little month, your little half a year,

Ere I forget, or die, or move away,

And we are done forever; by and by

I shall forget you, as I said, but now,

If you entreat me with your loveliest lie

I will protest you with my favorite vow.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

I would indeed that love were longer-lived,

And oaths were not so brittle as they are,

But so it is, and nature has contrived

To struggle on without a break thus far,—

Whether or not we find what we are seeking

Is idle, biologically speaking.

## Intention To Escape From Him

I think I will learn some beautiful language, useless for commercial

Purposes, work hard at that.

I think I will learn the Latin name of every songbird, not only in

America but wherever they sing.

(Shun meditation, though; invite the controversial:

Is the world flat? Do bats eat cats?) By digging hard I might

deflect that river, my mind, that uncontrollable thing,

Turgid and yellow, srong to overflow its banks in spring,

carrying away bridges

A bed of pebbles now, through which there trickles one clear

narrow stream, following a course henceforth nefast—

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Dig, dig; and if I come to ledges, blast.

# [Leonard Cohen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen)

## What I'm doing here

I do not know if the world has lied

I have lied

I do not know if the world has conspired against love

I have conspired against love

The atmosphere of torture is no comfort

I have tortured

Even without the mushroom cloud

still I would have hated

Listen

I would have done the same things

even if there were no death

I will not be held like a drunkard

under the cold tap of facts

I refuse the universal alibi

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Like an empty telephone booth passed at night

and remembered

like mirrors in a movie palace lobby consulted

only on the way out

like a nymphomaniac who binds a thousand

into strange brotherhood

I wait

for each one of you to confess

"kitty". sixteen, 5' 11", white, prostitute.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

## Filling Station

Oh, but it is dirty!

--this little filling station,

oil-soaked, oil-permeated

to a disturbing, over-all

black translucency.

Be careful with that match!

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Father wears a dirty,

oil-soaked monkey suit

that cuts him under the arms,

and several quick and saucy

and greasy sons assist him

(it's a family filling station),

all quite thoroughly dirty.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Do they live in the station?

It has a cement porch

behind the pumps, and on it

a set of crushed and grease-

impregnated wickerwork;

on the wicker sofa

a dirty dog, quite comfy.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Some comic books provide

the only note of color--

of certain color. They lie

upon a big dim doily

draping a taboret

(part of the set), beside

a big hirsute begonia.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Why the extraneous plant?

Why the taboret?

Why, oh why, the doily?

(Embroidered in daisy stitch

with marguerites, I think,

and heavy with gray crochet.)

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Somebody embroidered the doily.

Somebody waters the plant,

or oils it, maybe. Somebody

arranges the rows of cans

so that they softly say:

ESSO--SO--SO--SO

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

to high-strung automobiles.

Somebody loves us all.

## In The Cemetery

"You see those mothers squabbling there?"

Remarks the man of the cemetery.

"One says in tears, ''Tis mine lies here!'

Another, 'Nay, mine, you Pharisee!'

Another, 'How dare you move my flowers

And put your own on this grave of ours!'

But all their children were laid therein

At different times, like sprats in a tin.

"And then the main drain had to cross,

And we moved the lot some nights ago,

And packed them away in the general foss

With hundreds more. But their folks don't know,

And as well cry over a new-laid drain

As anything else, to ease your pain!"

## This Is A Photograph Of Me

It was taken some time ago

At first it seems to be

a smeared

print: blurred lines and grey flecks

blended with the paper;

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

then, as you scan

it, you can see something in the left-hand corner

a thing that is like a branch: part of a tree

(balsam or spruce) emerging

and, to the right, halfway up

what ought to be a gentle

slope, a small frame house.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

In the background there is a lake,

and beyond that, some low hills.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

(The photograph was taken

the day after I drowned.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

I am in the lake, in the center

of the picture, just under the surface.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

It is difficult to say where

precisely, or to say

how large or how small I am:

the effect of water

on light is a distortion.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

but if you look long enough

eventually

you will see me.)

## Deaf-Mute In A Pear Tree

His clumsy body is a golden fruit

pendulous in the pear tree

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Blunt fingers among the multitudinous buds

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Adriatic blue the sky above and through

the forking twigs

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Sun ruddying tree's trunk, his trunk

his massive head thick-knobbed with burnished curls

tight-clenched in bud

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

(Painting by Generalic. Primitive.)

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

I watch him prune with silent secateurs

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Boots in the crotch of branches shift their weight

heavily as oxen in a stall

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Hear small inarticulate mews from his locked mouth

a kitten in a box

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Pear clippings fall

                   soundlessly on the ground

Spring finches sing

                   soundlessly in the leaves

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

A stone. A stone in ears and on his tongue

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Through palm and fingertip he knows the tree's

quick springtime pulse

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Smells in its sap the sweet incipient pears

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Pale sunlight's choppy water glistens on

his mutely snipping blades

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

and flags and scraps of blue

above him make regatta of the day

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

But when he sees his wife's foreshortened shape

sudden and silent in the grass below

uptilt its face to him

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

then air is kisses, kisses

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

stone dissolves

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

his locked throat finds a little door

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

and through it feathered joy

flies screaming like a jay

## History Of A Tough Motherfucker

he came to the door one night wet thin beaten and

terrorized

a white cross-eyed tailless cat

I took him in and fed him and he stayed

grew to trust me until a friend drove up the driveway

and ran him over

I took what was left to a vet who said,"not much

chance…give him these pills…his backbone

is crushed, but is was crushed before and somehow

mended, if he lives he'll never walk, look at

these x-rays, he's been shot, look here, the pellets

are still there…also, he once had a tail, somebody

cut it off…"

I took the cat back, it was a hot summer, one of the

hottest in decades, I put him on the bathroom

floor, gave him water and pills, he wouldn't eat, he

wouldn't touch the water, I dipped my finger into it

and wet his mouth and I talked to him, I didn't go any-

where, I put in a lot of bathroom time and talked to

him and gently touched him and he looked back at

me with those pale blue crossed eyes and as the days went

by he made his first move

dragging himself forward by his front legs

(the rear ones wouldn't work)

he made it to the litter box

crawled over and in,

it was like the trumpet of possible victory

blowing in that bathroom and into the city, I

related to that cat-I'd had it bad, not that

bad but bad enough

one morning he got up, stood up, fell back down and

just looked at me.

"you can make it," I said to him.

he kept trying, getting up falling down, finally

he walked a few steps, he was like a drunk, the

rear legs just didn't want to do it and he fell again, rested,

then got up.

you know the rest: now he's better than ever, cross-eyed

almost toothless, but the grace is back, and that look in

his eyes never left…

and now sometimes I'm interviewed, they want to hear about

life and literature and I get drunk and hold up my cross-eyed,

shot, runover de-tailed cat and I say,"look, look

at this!"

but they don't understand, they say something like,"you

say you've been influenced by Celine?"

"no," I hold the cat up,"by what happens, by

things like this, by this, by this!"

I shake the cat, hold him up in

the smoky and drunken light, he's relaxed he knows…

it's then that the interviews end

although I am proud sometimes when I see the pictures

later and there I am and there is the cat and we are photo-

graphed together.

he too knows it's bullshit but that somehow it all helps.

**Update:** my second most literate friend has sent me another great poem that needs to be added to this post:

# [Thomas Kinsella](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kinsella)

## Mirror in February

The day dawns, with scent of must and rain,

Of opened soil, dark trees, dry bedroom air.

Under the fading lamp, half dressed -- my brain

Idling on some compulsive fantasy --

I towel my shaven jaw and stop, and stare,

Riveted by a dark exhausted eye,

A dry downturning mouth.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

It seems again that it is time to learn,

In this untiring, crumbling place of growth

To which, for the time being, I return.

Now plainly in the mirror of my soul

I read that I have looked my last on youth

And little more; for they are not made whole

That reach the age of Christ.

<span style="opacity: 0; -moz-opacity:0;">Break</span>

Below my window the wakening trees,

Hacked clean for better bearing, stand defaced

Suffering their brute necessities;

And how should the flesh not quail, that span for span

Is mutilated more? In slow distaste

I fold my towel with what grace I can, 

Not young, and not renewable, but man.
