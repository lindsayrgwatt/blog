Few things in America are as touchy as gun control. Seattle is a microcosm of this: you'll regularly meet people who think no one should ever own a firearm and then see a pickup truck pass by with a sticker like the following:

I think it fundamentally comes down to a few things, starting with freedom.

America is the free-est place on Earth. It's the freedom to do just about whatever you want that has made it the most advanced economy on the planet and raised hundreds of millions out of poverty. Americans are paranoid about giving up this freedom; there's a belief (and I believe rightly) that if you start regulating

1\. Government wants you guns

2\. All guns are bad guns
