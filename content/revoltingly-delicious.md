The other day I was exploring Little Saigon and found myself in a grocery store where I discovered this:

[<img src="{static}/images/2014/01/20140104-135551.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" alt="20140104-135551.jpg" />]({static}/images/2014/01/20140104-135551.jpg)  
Yes, durian is now available as jam. And it's not your everyday breakfast experience.

When you open the jar, it's hard not to gag as a whiff of durian greets you. It's like someone let something rot in your kitchen.

As you spread it on your bread a bit of buyer's remorse sets in. Why did I spend $5 on this imported crap? Is it fair to subject bread to this? Does bread have feelings?

When you go to eat your toast, you let it pause for a second above your lips and the aroma starts to trickle into the back of your throat. A gag is imminent if you don't bite, so you take the plunge.

And the world instantly changes. A sweet, smooth flavor rolls over your tongue. And as you chew then swallow a slightly smoky sweetness lingers in your mouth.

Revolting the delicious. Revoltingly delicious. And not for everyone or everyday but a great find.
