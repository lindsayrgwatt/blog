I was going through an old German magazine the other day and came across this ad, which I thought worth sharing:

[<img src="{static}/images/2008/10/castor_small.jpg" title="German Newspaper Ad" class="aligncenter size-full " width="500" height="385" />]({static}/images/2008/10/castor_small.jpg)

At first it doesn't look like much.  I mean after all, it's just a train set, right?  Actually, it's a little more subtle than that.  It's called the "Stop-den-castor-start-set" which would translate as "Stop the nuclear train beginner's set".  The 'castor' refers to a canister holding nuclear waste that was sent to Germany for reprocessing.  Every couple of years these are sent from France and there are [inevitable riots](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3995091.stm) and [then more riots](http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/04/11/france.nuclear/index.html).  Here's a photo from the 2006 installment:

<img src="http://www.indymedia.org/images/2006/11/874857.jpg" title="German Train Track Fires" class="aligncenter" width="480" height="360" />

If you look closely at the ad, you can see the following:

- A protester has tied himself to the tracks (top)
- In the middle are farm equipment (used to block the tracks) and protesters (carrying placards saying "We're against this")
- In the bottom is a sample of what the actual 'castor' looks like: a massive container mounted on a flatbed

I thought it a great ad and worth sharing.  The paper also gets a bonus for their slogan: "The traditional paper for the new philistines."
