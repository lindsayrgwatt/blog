Wen and I are chilling out in our apartment tonight in the interregnum between going on holiday and moving into a new place.  To celebrate, we decided to watch [Edward Burtynsky](http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/)'s [*Manufactured Landscapes*](http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/Introduction/Manufactured_Landscapes.html).  It's one of those films you can put on in the background and have a conversation and not miss a beat.  That's not because it's a bad movie, rather the opposite: Burtynsky's a photographer whose work is on such a massive scale that you need to talk about it to digest it.

I've seen the movie a few times and one of my favourite scenes are shots of California Freeways.  I find them fascinating because Los Angeles was once (and potentially again) a [city that was car friendly](http://gregor.us/california/lost-pearblossom-highway/).  LA is where America's love affair with the car - and all the drama that comes along with a fantastic lover - can best be seen.  In fact, perhaps no more than on [Interstate 405](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Freeway).  For those of you who have no idea why Interstate 405 is so fascinating (after all, it's just a strip of road between San Diego and LA, right?), here are some shots of the on- and offramps.  They're both beautiful (as works of engineering) and disgusting (as symbols of technology run wild) at the same time.
