If you live in NYC, chances are that you're voting for Obama (as a non-American I'm one of the lucky few who don't have to choose sides).  [Yahoo's Political Dashboard](http://news.yahoo.com/election/2008/dashboard) has him leading here 60 to 35.  What's amazing me is how he's become a cult of personality.

You may have seen the [Shepard Fairey Obama paintings](http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en-us&q=shepard%20fairey%20obama&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wi), but what really struck me was the window display the other day when I walked past [Brooklyn Industries](http://www.brooklynindustries.com/brooklyn/) on 8th.  They make inexpensive, trendy clothes sold overwhelmingly to young, white New Yorkers.  And they've placed a Barack Obama mask over each of their mannequins (even the female ones).

Obama is really resonating with a block of Americans in ways I've never seen before.  As a corollary, I can't imagine Brooks Brothers doing this for John McCain.
