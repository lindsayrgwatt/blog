I love bands who dance to their own music.  It's as if they wrote their own songs as nobody else could create anything they could listen to.  Over the years I've found that these bands tend to put on the best shows.

And so it was last night at [Webster Hall](http://websterhall.com/) where [Cut Copy](http://www.myspace.com/cutcopy) tore the place apart (on a Monday night!).  The overwhelming feeling was that they loved their own music - but not in a narcissistic way.  Rather, it was as though the band had a goal to make people dance and their music just happens to be the best way yet they've found to get a thousand people to dance together.

It was a great show.  Here's a photo:
