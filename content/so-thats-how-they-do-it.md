There's a [fascinating article in the Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-0804-netflixaug04,0,6424990.story) about how [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com) delivers their DVDs. Â I have a nerdy love of companies that are really, really good at what they do (Toyota, Amazon, etc.) so this sort of article always interests me.

Here are some killer numbers for you:

- 95 percent of titles are rented every 90 days
- every day they go through their entire nation-wide inventory of 89 million discs and figure out where each is
- less than 1 quarter of 1 percent of discs are mistakenly shipped

No wonder these guys are worth $2.6 billion.
