This morning started at 6am with a quick run along the beach in Sydney.  In Manly, the surfers were already out, catching the morning breaks before grabbing the ferry to work.  I reached the North Head at seven and had it all to myself as I watched the surf break below the cliffs.

About 18 hours later - and still Monday - I had the unique vantage point of 37,000 feet to watch the sun simultaneously rise over the Santa Monica Mountains (snow-covered and beautiful) and light up the oil rigs offshore of LA.  In case you're wondering, yes, there was a ridiculous amount of traffic snaking along the LA freeways at that hour.

Now it's 9:30pm - and still Monday -  and I'm back in New York, happily satiated after a [Patsy's Pizza](http://www.patsyspizzeriany.com/) and enjoying the comfort of our apartment.  By my calculations, it has been almost a 32 hour day and it's still going strong...
