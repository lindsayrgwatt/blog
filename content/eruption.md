This week an undersea volcano erupted off the coast of Tonga.  This is a truly spectacular rare event that happens to have been captured by many news organizations.  If you haven't seen any photos, here's the warm-up:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/03/warmup-300x200.jpg" title="Tonga Volcano" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="200" alt="Tonga Volcano" />

And launch, as captured by the AP's Lothar Slabon via the New Zealand Herald:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/03/exploding-volcano-1-300x215.jpg" title="Tonga Volcano" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="215" alt="Tonga Volcano" />

Lothar's getting good mileage out of this event, because he sold the same photo - just uncropped and untouched - to the AFP and they posted it too:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/03/exploding-volcano-2-300x225.jpg" title="Exploding Volcano 2" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="225" alt="Exploding Volcano 2" />I'm now starting to wonder about how much of my paper's news is actually written by them versus just a slightly different version that they've licensed from the same source as their competitors.  No wonder old media is dying...
