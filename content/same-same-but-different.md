You wouldn't think that young Chinese and Americans have too much in common, but two recent news articles suggest that they might.

The first article talks about [Millennials in America entering the workforce](http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2010/03/10/2010-03-10_millennials_want_more_vacation_value_time_off_the_job_more_than_young_work_force.html):

> Millennials want more vacation and time for themselves away from the job than young people did 30 years ago, and they also value compensation more, according to a recent study.  
> ...
>
> Millennials, the youngest generation in American workplaces, may see time off as necessary because of how hard they saw their parents work, said [San Diego State University](http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/San+Diego+State+University "San Diego State University") psychology professor [Jean Twenge](http://www.nydailynews.com/topics/Jean+Twenge "Jean Twenge").

Today there's an article talking about how [young Chinese workers are getting pickier](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100313/ap_on_bi_ge/as_china_picky_workers;_ylt=AqVRnsY9yCn2KK3oq8zI_zus0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTNxc3N2M25nBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTAwMzEzL2FzX2NoaW5hX3BpY2t5X3dvcmtlcnMEY2NvZGUDbW9zdHBvcHVsYXIEY3BvcwM2BHBvcwMzBHB0A2hvbWVfY29rZQRzZWMDeW5faGVhZGxpbmVfbGlzdARzbGsDY2hpbmFzbmV3Z2Vu) about the jobs they're looking for:

> Their attitudes and expectations are vastly different from those of their parents, who hunkered down onassembly lines for little pay and helped turn China into a manufacturing juggernaut. Many younger workers won't do the sweatshop jobs their parents did. They grew up with greater prosperity in families limited by theone-child policy. They are more used to getting their way.

> "It's true that we're less willing to eat bitterness," Chen said with a chuckle, using a popular Chinese phrase for enduring hardship. "We're better educated. We know we have rights. Times have changed."

Very interesting to see these similar attitudes emerging amongst similar aged people in wildly different countries.
