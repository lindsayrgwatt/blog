I recently went to Dublin for my brother's graduation from med school (<a href="http://gallery.mac.com/lindsayrgwatt#100016&amp;bgcolor=black&amp;view=grid" target="_self" title="Photos of Andrew&#39;s Grad">photos</a>) and to visit a friend (<a href="http://gallery.mac.com/lindsayrgwatt#100023&amp;bgcolor=black&amp;view=grid" target="_self" title="Photos of Dublin">photos</a>).  Imagine my surprise when I came upon the following map while reading the Aer Lingus in-flight magazine:

Upstate New York, Vermont and Maine have all moved a little further north than they should be.  Here's a close-up:

From what I can tell, Rochester has moved over to be <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.241677,-78.514824&amp;spn=0.132233,0.244102&amp;t=h&amp;z=12" target="_self" title="Eastmain, Nunavut">Eastmain, Nunavut</a>.  Burlington is <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=56.287584,-76.203918&amp;spn=0.958856,1.95282&amp;z=9" target="_self" title="Lac Guillaume-Delsisle">Lac Guillaume-Delisle</a> and Syracuse is <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=55.056349,-73.580933&amp;spn=1.979062,3.90564&amp;z=8" target="_self" title="Lac Bienville">Lac Bienville</a> (ironically, I don't even think there's a road within 100 km of Lac Bienville).

This map would be really funny except for the fact that Aer Lingus is an airline and there job is to actually know where places are.
