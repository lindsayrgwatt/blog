I work for [an Internet company](http://www.webmd.com).  I've noticed that a lot of the time I have a totally different perspective from my non-Internet geek friends on how the world works.  I think that this is largely due to the fact that working for an Internet comany is like giving a man a hammer: everything becomes a nail.

However, every now and then I'm shown something that reminds me that the world is genuinely composed of many, many nails.  Today it's a slide (#127) from a [Morgan Stanley presentation](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2009/03/mary_meeker_on.html) on the economy and the Internet.  This one's a killer:

The skinny: newspapers get a tonne of ad dollars, but little time by users.  Mobile and the Internet are the exact opposite.  There's a lot of discussion as to [how advertising is going to play out](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/03/22/why-advertising-is-failing-on-the-internet/) on these platforms, but it's safe to say that these areas are going to keep growing for the forseeable future.  If you're not thinking about the web or the mobile web, start thinking about it.  If you work for a newspaper, run for the hills (or at least their web department).
