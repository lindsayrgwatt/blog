Wen and I went for a huge walk around Brooklyn today. In honor of a [recent NY Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/realestate/20living.html) on [Crown Heights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Heights,_Brooklyn), we decided to wander over and check out the [historic district](http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/CHN_report.pdf) (PDF).

It - plus surrounding [Bed Stuy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford%E2%80%93Stuyvesant,_Brooklyn) - are a truly unique area and well worth a visit; here are some photos.

The historic district starts with a couple of gorgeous old apartment buildings - The Bedfordshire and The Imperial.

Around the corner, it's time for homemade iced tea. Note the peeling paint; what makes Crown Heights so interesting is that there's a huge variability in both the architectural styles and also the quality of the buildings. Abandoned buildings sit next to million dollar row houses.

﻿﻿﻿There are many, many local churches (almost all Baptist or Pentecostal):

Note the scimitar in the carving below!

We paused for shaved ice; well worth the $1.

This guy could have used some shaved ice; it was damn hot.

A couple more photos, showing the local character:

The Brooklyn Public Library (Eastern Parkway Branch) is right on the edge of Crown Heights:

And finally, a shot of the Union Street Bridge's administrative building. Not anywhere near to Crown Heights, but I liked the photo.
