It is getting progressively harder for us to wash our clothes.

In Tokyo we found a coin laundromat that sold soap and had washer and dryers.

In Hong Kong we were able to drop it off at a laundrette and the next day it was ready.

Here in Borneo we're washing everything ourselves and the humidity means that it takes at least a day to dry.

At this rate we'll be wearing dirty clothes soon.
