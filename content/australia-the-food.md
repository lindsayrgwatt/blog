One of the surprising pleasures of our trip to Australia was how incredible the food was.  Here are a couple of things we noticed:

# Quality of Ingredients

The Aussies have incredibly high quality food, particularly produce.  Check this out:

# Beets & Pumpkin

It turns out that Australians pride themselves in their ability to put beets and pumpkin into everything:

I had pumpkin served as part of a pasta sauce, with Thai duck and even packed into a spinach, feta and pumpkin pie.  This isn't however your traditional North American pumpkin:

You can see that there's a lot more meat, they're smaller and the skin is green.  There are also many different types of pumpkin, although, frankly, they all taste like pumpkin to me...

# Asian Food

Since Australia considers Asia to be it's sphere of influence, it's only appropriate that it has great pan-Asian cuisine.

At [Mamak](http://www.mamak.com.au/) we found true Malaysian food, with an emphasis on satay and rotis - including the first authentic [Murtabak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murtabak) (a roti filled with onions and meat; served with curry) I've had since I left Singapore:

The other fun thing about Mamak is that as you wait you can watch them make rotis.  It's like watching the equivalent of Asian pizza-making:

Mamak also gets bonus points for having Ayam Berempah (a dish where a breast of bone-in chicken is diced and cooked in whole spices like cardamon, cinammon, cloves, star anise, onions, chili and coriander) and [teh tarik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teh_tarik) (sweet Malaysian tea).

We also had great [Char Siu Bao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_siu_baau) (pork-filled dumplings) at the Chinese fast food chain Wu Da Niang Dim Sum (How often can you go to a Chinese-owned Chinese food fast food chain?):

I was also super-excited as I found buns with [pork floss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong) for sale in Chinatown:

# The Humble Meat Pie

Australians love their meat pies (probably that British influence).  One of the classic places in Sydney to get a meat pie is [Harry's Cafe de Wheels](http://www.harryscafedewheels.com.au/Home.aspx?element=1&category=1) (it's been making pies next to the Woolloomooloo pier since 1945):

I had their curry meat pie; hunks of beef mixed with curry sauce; quite spicy:

# Wine Pairings

Australia is famous for its wine and the have developed a food culture paired around the wine.  If you go to wine country (we went to [Mudgee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudgee,_New_South_Wales)) any restaurant can give you great recommendations on what wine to have with the meal.

We had lunch at [The Wineglass](http://www.cobbandcocourt.com.au/wineglass.php) and here's the cheese plate that came with the wine:[<img src="{static}/images/2009/01/img_7968.jpg" title="Cheese Plate" class="aligncenter size-full " width="400" height="266" />]({static}/images/2009/01/img_7968.jpg)
