Over the past few days I've noticed these billboards around the neighbourhood:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/05/img_0101-260x300.jpg" title="Billboard" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="260" height="300" alt="Billboard" />

It's just blood on the floor, right?  Oh, wait...  I'm a sucker for these perceptual illusions, here's an [explanation for why they work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion#Cognitive_illusions).

PS If all you see is blood, add a comment and I'll tell you what to look for...
