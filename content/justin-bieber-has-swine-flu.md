Alright, I admit it, I don't know if Justin Bieber has swine flu, but you could be forgiven thinking that if you typed "[What are the symptoms of swine flu?](http://www.ask.com/web?q=what+are+the+symptoms+of+swine+flu&search=&qsrc=0&o=0&l=dir)" into [Ask.com](http://www.ask.com):

You're seeing two things:

1.  An over-reliance on algorithms.  They're showing other questions asked by people who also asked "What are the symptoms of swine flu?"  The most popular co-occurring questions are shown - and Ask's computers naively show them as they know nothing about what the questions mean
2.  A glimpse into what people are looking for/how they use their computers.  Usually these algorithms are based on what similar questions people asked in the same session - this means that these people were asking about both swine flu and young Bieber within a short time period of one another or never close their web browsers (so the session never ends)
