On Wednesday night I attended a meeting by the [IxDA](http://www.ixda.org/)'s New York chapter talking about the current state of [interaction design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_design).  It was an enlightening conversation.  If you know nothing about the topic, here's a laundry list of things they talked about:

- There was an emphasis on "bringing design back": the need to find a balance of the art and science of design.  If you've no idea of what this means, [Frank Gehry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry) is the poster child for design as art; [Jacob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/) for design as science.  Each evokes fiery passion amongst their supporters.  The iPhone is currently considered the best bridge of the two: cutting edge materials science combined with an artistic, empathetic experience.
- As interaction designers seek to find this balance, they're exploring the "craft" aspect of their profession.  One popular tool for this is sketching experiences: think [Bill Verplank](http://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/250a/lectures/IDSketchbok.pdf) (pdf) and [Bill Buxton](http://www.billbuxton.com/).
- Similar to this, interaction designers are struggling to reconcile that their profession is a combination of design and engineering - which brings a set of challenges.  Engineers tend to focus on one issue and keep iterating to a solution; each iteration gets closer.  Designers are much more nonlinear; they iterate on mulitple rounds of designs but are constantly bringing old designs back into the process.
- An interesting concept that was bandied about talked about "great design being the embodiment of a story".  A few examples are a [Nokia nano-tech phone video](nano.html&feature=player_embedded) and the [Google Chrome comic](http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/).  The iPhone come up again here; the idea being that a user's interaction with it is a narrative and it tells you what to expect.
- This led to a nice discussion about product ecosystems.  From a designer's perspective, the ecosystem enables a new set of experiences when you connect people using the products inside the ecosystem.  Examples are the [Nike Plus](http://nikeplus.nike.com/nikeplus/) social network for runners and a [Ford concept](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28140688/) that takes performance and geolocation data from hybrid cars and shares it with other hybrid owners.
- Here are three more random thoughts from the session:
  - Designers don't create ideas, they create things that embody the idea
  - [Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/) is fascinating as they created a web service that was designed to require no website; in theory, you never need to go to it - you can just use APIs instead
  - Wireframes are not a good enough tool.  They do not have enough fidelity as they lack the dimension of time

A small bonus: the session was held at [Bloomberg's amazing headquarters](http://images.businessweek.com/ss/05/11/wondersoftheworld/source/2.htm).  I snapped this photo before a security guard ran me down and told me "no more photos".
