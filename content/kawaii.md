The Japanese have a great word, *kawaii*, to refer to their [prediliction for "precious", "adorable" and "cute" characters in their culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness_in_Japanese_culture) (click the link to read how mechanical pencils started an underground revolution - that's an unanticipated consequence if every there was one).  A few years back Wendy went to Japan and brought me back a ridiculously kawaii notepad.  It's cute to the point of being useless and absolutely fascinating at the same time.

Today I found the pad as I was cleaning some stuff up, so I've scanned each of the types of pages here for you.  Click the thumbnails for the cuteness:
