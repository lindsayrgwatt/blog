Last night's fireworks were a bit of a disappointment for those in Manhattan.  A combination of rain and wind conspired to blow all the smoke from the detonations towards us - and obscured the fireworks.  However, there was one amazing sight: the image of hundreds of people on their rooftops holding umbrellas as they strained to see the explosions.  Here's what it looked like (click the image to enlarge it):
