I couldn't help but notice all the chatter on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) today about Barack Obama's election as the 44th President of the United States.  Here are a couple of status updates by my friends (who, it should be mentioned are overwhelmingly in the Obama demographic: highly educated, urban 25-35 year olds-but mostly not American):

> ABC is raising a glass to the US voters with relief and a heartfelt thank-you

> DEF can't wait to see the White House occupied by an African-American family, as it should have been since 143 years ago

> GHI (American) has renewed optimism with our new charismatic, unifying leader...

> JKL (American) is glad he won't have to listen to people in the middle east complain to him about US polotics \[sic\] for the next 4 years! 

> MNO is impressed by America today.

> PQR (American) is alternating between pinching herself and drinking champagne, pinching herself and drinking champagne....

> STU (American) YES WE DID!

> VWX is is \[sic\] hopeful that today is the dawn of a new era for the US and the world.

> YZA thinks she picked a good year to establish permanent residency in the US! (and is happy 123 went blue).

> BCD is OBAMA-licious.

> EFG (American) is inspired to use her status line to congratulate Ohio (and the rest of you) on an election well done. Cleveland Baracks!

Here's to the next four years:
