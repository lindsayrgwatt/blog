It's that time of year again: to reflect on what I did or didn't do in the prior year and attempt to chart a plan for the current one.

What were my goals for 2011? According to this [blog post](http://lindsayrgwatt.com/blog/2011/01/out-with-2010-and-in-with-2011/), I had four:

1.  Launch my own company. This one happened. [Placeling](http://www.placeling.com/) is up and running - and if you own an iPhone and haven't downloaded it yet, your first new year's resolution should be to do so.
2.  Meet a lot of interesting people. This one also happened, although not quite as I expected. By launching my own company, I've met a tonne of interesting people; now I need to figure out how to continue this in the new year
3.  Do less, better. Yup, again, this happened. I focused on a few things in 2011 and it worked
4.  Run a 3:10 marathon. Close, but no cigar. Ran a 3:15 in May. Tried again in October but ran a 3:18 instead. I need to retool how I run if I'm going to ever do this

And I had a secret fifth goal: start a family. And this one worked: my son was born in November.

So, what's up for 2012?

Well, there are some unspoken resolutions: I've got to be a good dad, a great husband and a good CEO at my company. But those are tablestakes; you don't really get any points for doing them as they're expected.

Here - in no particular order - is what I'm going to try in 2012:

- **Manage stress better**: find a way to do yoga once a week plus one of running/biking/swimming/boxing. Cook more and make the meals healthier. I hit a low point in November where I was gritting my teeth; need to learn to be better at managing stress
- **Be more creative**: I'm going to finally use all the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/)-related stuff I bought a few years ago: Wen and I are going to make a robot. I'm going to cook a new meal every week. I'm going to code for at least 30 days straight to really learn Rails. I need to blog more
- **Not buy a book**: I love books, but I've got a stack of unread books I've accumulated over the past few years. I'm going to read them all before I buy a new one. *Heuristics and Biases*: this is your year (NOTE: I'm talking to Wendy as I write this and she already predicts I fail; the gauntlet has been dropped)
- **Get hyper-organize**: I signed up for a year of [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/) plus I'm using [Mint](http://www.mint.com). We'll see how this goes, but I'm going to try and get everything into the cloud and see if it changes how I think/behave

There you go. The 2012 list. Check in a year from now to see how it goes.
