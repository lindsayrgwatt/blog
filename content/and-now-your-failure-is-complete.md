Well, it's official.  The WaMu in my building has now become a Chase:

I'll be interested to see if Chase keeps any aspects of the old WaMu.  While the bank was run by a bunch of terrible executives, they did provide one great thing: the experience of using the bank.  You didn't stand in a line, instead you went to a 'greeter' who took you to the right person to help you; you didn't talk to someone via a reinforced bulletproof glass window, you did it side by side.  (At one point, [WaMu was recognized by Fortune magazine](http://newsroom.wamu.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=189529&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=695820&highlight=) for this).   I hope Chase realizes that the retail experience had nothing to do with the collapse of the bank and doesn't do away with it completely...
