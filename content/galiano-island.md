It hasn't been much of a summer here in Vancouver and we're learning that the best way to deal with it is to just get outside and do things. So on Saturday we got up early and went to Galiano Island. Due to the interminable fog, the view from the ferry wasn't too great:

When we got there, it rained and kept raining. Fortunately, this created quite eerie and unique circumstances up on top of Bluff Park. Normally you'd look out over Active Pass and see the boats passing between the islands. Needless to say, we were treated to something quite different (but equally beautiful):

We had a great time trekking through rainforest, skirting cliffs and pushing through eight foot hight grasses while startling deer and eagles. Can't wait to go back on a day when it's actually a clear day...
