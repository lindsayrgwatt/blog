I was waiting for the subway in the (overheated) 1st Ave L train station when I saw this ad:

[<img src="{static}/images/2008/08/img_0052.jpg" title="Subway Grafitti" class="aligncenter size-full " width="500" height="375" />]({static}/images/2008/08/img_0052.jpg)

Yes, it's been totally defaced, but honestly, I like the new version much better than the original.  In fact, one of the pleasures of living in NYC is the quality of graffiti - particularly people who deface ads.  Through some odd coincidence, we not only have the best copywriters and graphic designers in the country, we also seem to have people who just know perfectly how to turn an ad into a source of ridicule.  Wait, maybe it's not a coincidence...
