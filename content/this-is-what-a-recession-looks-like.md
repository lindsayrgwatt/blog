This is what a recession looks like. It's 3:15 on a Friday afternoon at Newark Liberty airport and there's nobody here. There should be the weekly mass exodus of business travellers fleeing New York for their homeland, but instead the airport feels more like a very lonely convention center.

I can't help but wonder what the airport in Washington is like...
