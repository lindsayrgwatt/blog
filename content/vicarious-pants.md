Sorry for the title; I just wanted the opportunity to put those two words together.  The reason they can legitimately go together is that the other day I bought a pair of (new) pants and this was in the pocket:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/04/kodachrome_1-300x299.jpg" title="Slide with Amphora" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="300" height="299" alt="Slide with Amphora" />That's right - inside my pocket was a slide of amphoras/vases in some Mediterranean market.  After getting over my shock of:

a\) Finding something inside my new pocket

b\) Discovering that that "something" was an archaic thing that my kids will almost certainly not understand

I found myself wondering where the actual photo was taken.  Was this a fleeting memory of someone's Moroccan vacation in the summer of 1950, transposed to my pants in 2009?  Perhaps instead it is actually a photo of a movie set in California where they're filming a Roman movie.  I've definitely never had a pair of pants make me think this much before...
