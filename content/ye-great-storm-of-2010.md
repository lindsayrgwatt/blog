It's been snowing for over 24 hours now in NYC, so I thought I'd post some photos.  If I had cross-country skis, I could have probably skied to work today.

Here are some shots of snowy Carroll Gardens:

This is the intersection of Union and Clinton; it would normally be awash in taxis, school buses and delivery trucks:

Absolutely no one is to be seen at 8th and 15th:

And, of course, someone seems to have panicked and thinks we're having an emergency.  This guy is wearing his "Red Cross Emergency Worker" outfit.  Please; it's just a snowstorm:

And finally, a shot of what it looks like from work.  That awkward looking grey phalange is the Empire State Building...
