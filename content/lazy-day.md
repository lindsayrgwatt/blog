It is the deliriously lazy Sunday of a long weekend today; one of those days where the slightest task feels as though it is an Odyssey-like challenge.  Wen and I have enjoyed a day of doing nothing, with the result that this blog post is about almost nothing.

One of our lazy Sunday traditions is brunch.  A favourite local spot of ours is the [Empire Diner](http://www.empire-diner.com/).  Here's a shot of it from this morning (or, perhaps, this afternoon as it was 1pm...).

Hope your Sunday was as good as ours.
