There's a great exhibit on right now at the [Charles H. Scott gallery](https://www.placeling.com/places/371b586b00168fcf3c49b5bbc1de049a826691d1) at Emily Carr.

Babak Golkar's *Grounds for Standing and Understanding* rethinks our everyday relationship to architecture.

At the end of the gallery sits an afghan rug; the patterns have been perfectly extruded to create a speculative cityscape.

To get to the rug you walk through a room full of sharply angled lines. If you've been to the gallery before, it feels all wrong: this wall wasn't here before? Why has the window been blacked out?

And then when you see the rug and its surface, it sort of makes sense. We're part of the exhibit and we're looking at ourselves, hidden in the everyday.

Trapped?

It's not clear, but the recursion gives you pause.

Well worth a visit.
