Hong Kong - and especially Kowloon - is a city of markets. You can buy almost anything.

There's a flower district...

...a bird market...

...and a fish market.

In fact, you can go down to the local food market and the butcher will sell you pieces of an animal that you didn't even know you want:

This makes for a fascinating trip around the city as you walk from market to market. The first three markets in this post are all within walking distance of each other. If you approached them from our hotel, you'd also find yourself walking through the leather interiors, sewing and building materials districts:

However, all this selling comes at a price. After a while, Hong Kong begins to feel like Manhattan with mountains instead of cultural institutions. You begin to realize that this is a city that exists solely for the sake of commerce. It's the market for the market's sake.

As Hong Kongers become very wealthy, they're adopting some of the shallower trappings of an upwardly mobile society. You can see this in the incredible number of subway ads for plastic surgery:

Hopefully this isn't the new look of Hong Kong.
