In his all too brief life so far, my son has picked up a variety of nicknames.

Some are variants on his name:

- Cammie
- Cambo
- Camiford
- Camdizzle
- Cameroonie
- Cameroondie
- Little Ram
- Rammers
- Ram Jam
- Jammers

Then there are the functional names he's picked up at different "growth phases":

- Lil Shrieky
- Lil Slumpty
- Slumptiford
- Standiford
- Droolio
- Rolltastico
- The Rooty Tooter
- Drama
- Dreh-Dreh (a particularly menacing version of "drama")
- Slappy
- Grabby
- Grabbity Grab Grabs
- The Jolly Jumper
- The Rolly Rumper
- The Skolly Skumper
- Chubbs

And then there are a few that make no sense whatsoever (usually a name I threatened to 'name' Cam before he was born; Wen wielded her veto):

- Humptiford
- Chisleworth
- Littlest Boo
- Little Nar

I know that more will emerge over the coming years.
