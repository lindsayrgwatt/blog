Wendy and I are currently in Australia visiting her parents who live on Sydney's Manly beach.  The easiest way to get to Manly from downtown is via the ferry - which happens to give you a phenomenal view of the [Sydney Opera House](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House).  Sadly, just after we got here we learned that [John Utzon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jørn_Utzon), the architect behind the building, had passed away at 90.  The [obituary in the Economist](http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12758955) eloquently captured the beauty of his masterpiece:

> What he wanted for Sydney was the effect he had noticed when tacking round the promontory at Elsinore, of the castle’s piled-up turrets against the piled-up clouds and his own billowing white sails; the liberation he had felt on the great platforms of the Mayan temples in Mexico, of being lifted above the dark jungle into another world of light; the height and presence of Gothic cathedrals, whose ogival shape was to show in the cross-sections of the Sydney roof-shells; and the curved, three-dimensional rib-work of boat-building, as he had watched his own father doing it at Aalborg. The load-bearing beams of the Opera House shells he called *spidsgattere*, in homage to the sharp-sterned boats his father made.

Here are some photos I snapped from the ferry; I leave it up to you to decide whether his building achieved his dream:
