It's the second last Wednesday of the month so the local drug dealers walked down the street from their corner at Hastings & Abbott to the Money Mart. You recognize them on sight; they're not very subtle at exchanging packages.

There was a lineup out the door at 10am; one woman was so distracted by doing her makeup she didn't notice that her heroin tube fell out of her purse.

The afternoon brought the normal cavalcade of ambulances and other emergency vehicles. There was an odd beauty as their lights shone off the water that slicked the streets after the day's rains.

Who knows what tonight holds. I won't find out as I'm going home, but if you want to find out, this unique DTES beauty pageant should repeat itself on November 21st or so.
