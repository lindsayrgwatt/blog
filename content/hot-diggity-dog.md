New York is crushing on the hot dog right now (witness [this](http://www.ediblecommunities.com/manhattan/july/august-2009/iconic-foods.htm) and [this](http://nymag.com/guides/summer/2009/57461/)).  As a result, Wen and I decided to devote Saturday to eating hot dogs.

Our first stop was at [Dogmatic](http://eatdogmatic.com/) near Union Square.  You get to pick your dog (i.e., pork vs. beef vs. lamb, etc.) and then pick your sauce (e.g., truffle & gruyere, yogurt, etc.).  I had the lamb & yogurt and it was a smashing success.  The bun is great too: it's a half a baguette:

Dogmatic also gets bonus points for their interior: you sit at a monolithic shared table:

Later we headed over to [Brooklyn Flea](http://brownstoner.com/brooklynflea/) to check out [Asia Dog](http://www.asiadognyc.com/)'s unique dogs.  Check out their flavours:

We split the vinh and the ito.  Next time I'm trying the wangding-although it requires a run first:

These hot dogs are definitely the taste of the summer.
