One of my new year's resolutions was to learn how to cook Thai food.  Tonight I finally got around to making a meal - chicken with Thai basil and cashews.

It turned out well: very aromatic, light and incredibly fresh.  Here's a shot (tastes much better than it looks); recipe follows:

Ingredients:

- 1.5 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
- 2 lemongrass stalks, white part only, finely chopped
- 3 small fresh red chiles, seeded and finely chopped.  Note: we used green chiles as that's all they had at the store and it still tasted great
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger
- 2 fresh cilantro roots, finely chopped.  Note: it's almost impossible to get cilantro root as it's cut off the cilantro in most stores.  Just chop up the stalk and it'll work fine
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil.  Note: we used olive oil and it still tasted great
- 2/3 cup cashews
- 1.5 tablespoons lime juice.  Note: that's about 2 limes, squeezed
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1.5 tablespoons light brown sugar
- 2 cups lightly packed fresh Thai basil.  Note: if you can't get Thai basil, normal basil will work
- 2 teaspoons cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon water

Directions:

- Place the chicken in a large bowl with the lemongrass, chilies, garlic, ginger and cilantro root.  Mix together well
- Heat a wok over medium heat, add 1 teaspoon of the oil, and swirl to coat the surface of the wok.  Add the cashews and cook for 1 minute or until lightly brown (note: you better stir 'em as they burn quickly).  Remove and drain on paper towels
- Heat the remaining oil in the wok, add the chicken in batches, and stir-fry over medium heat for 4-5 minutes or until browned.  Return the chicken to the wok
- Stir in the lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, and basil, and cook for 30-60 seconds or until the basil just begins to wilt.  Add the cornstarch mixture and stir fry until the mixture thickens slightly.  Stir in the cashews and serve with steamed rice
