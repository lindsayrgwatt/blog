I was walking through Brooklyn the other day when I saw this flyer for a party, that, alas, had already occurred:

[<img src="{static}/images/2009/09/img_0129-225x300.jpg" title="Ridiculous Flyer" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="225" height="300" alt="Ridiculous Flyer" />]({static}/images/2009/09/img_0129.jpg)

At first, I thought, "what a great idea - you just wear the colour that matches you."  But the more I thought about it, I'm not sure what I would have worn.

See, it's unclear from the invite whether one should wear just one colour or mix 'n match.  Let's imagine that you're supposed to wear just one colour.  What would I do?  I'm taken (gold) and feign at success (purple).  Ironically, the only item I have that matches this is my old high school basketball uniform (a classic Halloween outfit), but it also includes white - and as mentioned, I'm not single.  Also, I could be ready to mingle and, not drunk, but then I'd be stuck wearing an outfit that looks like it was designed by a colour blind child with a love of earth tones.

So maybe one is supposed to wear only one colour.  Again though, what to wear?  Am I taken or just wanting to be successful?  And if I'm not drunk?  Alas, as the mathematicians would say "the dimensions aren't orthogonal" and so I fall into multiple categories but can only dress as one.

However, I'll never know what I would have worn as I only found the flyer after the party had already happened.  If anyone comes across any photos of this party, please send 'em my way - I'd love to see the baffling colours.
