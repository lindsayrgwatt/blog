It's a long weekend here in Canada, so I've got three days to catch up with everything I've been meaning to read (and watch).

Here's a rundown so you can play along at home:

1\. [Kathryn Schulz on being wrong](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/04/being-wrong-and-getting-stuck.html) (@TED)

Great insight: feeling wrong feels a lot light feeling right. It's only *realizing* that you're wrong that feels bad.

2\. [Cormac McCarthy, Lawrence Krauss & Werner Herzog on science & art](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2011/04/cormac_mccarthy.html)

Science. Art. History. What it means to be human. Where we might go. These guys do not see the world in the same way as you and I.

3\. [Salman Rushdie - Writer's Block](http://castroller.com/Podcasts/TheMothPodcast/2250650-Salman%20Rushdie%20Writers%20Block) (The Moth)

How he finished one of his books. In a most unanticipated fashion.

4\. [State of Play](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/profiles/state_of_play.php)

The curious, intriguing and awkward world of KidZania, where kids play at being adults.

5\. [Welcome to the Far Eastern Conference](http://www.gq.com/sports/profiles/201105/stephon-marbury-china-basketball?printable=true)

The Stephon Marbury story: kind of like a basketball version of a Greek tragedy but set in China and actually a comedy.

6\. [The Straight Dope](http://www.guernicamag.com/interviews/2530/simon_4_1_11/)

*The Wire* is the best show on television in my lifetime and I've recently been re-watching it. So imagine my joy at finding this interview between David Simon (the creator) and Bill Moyers. Topics include the drug war, the importance of a free press and the future of America.

7\. [City Views](http://reason.com/archives/2001/06/01/city-views/singlepage)

Jane Jacobs talks (in 2001) to the folks at *Reason* on cities. As a Canadian I couldn't help but notice the line: *It's really surprising how few creative, important cities Canada has for its size, its population, and its great human potential and attributes.*

8\. [Same Old New World Cities](http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2011/04/same-old-new-world-cities.html)

Some interesting thoughts on how cities in Australia are going to have to change to address the 21st century. I like the approach of framing it in terms of "what does our country stand for?" and "what are the inexorable trends of the next 50 years?"

9\. [How Skateboard King Mark "Gator" Anthony Was Born Again As A Rapist And Murderer](http://karmak.org/archive/2003/12/gator.html)

A fascinating if, ultimately, unhappy tale. The last section of the story puts the rest of the well-written reporting into context.

10\. [The Coming Storm](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2011/05/bangladesh/belt-text)

Bangladesh as a preview for what climate change could mean: lots of change and a need to be incredibly adaptive. I'd also never heard of the fascinating *char dwellers* before reading this article.

11\. [The Missing Mahatma](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/329fvswo.asp?nopager=1)

A long essay exploring why there has not been a Gandhi- or MLK-like figure in the Palestinian conflict.

12\. [Heroin.com: Selling Junk Online](http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/2524085/)

The *Village Voice* explores the business of selling drugs on Craigslist. As you read, be sure to look up some of their search terms and see if you can find some online drug ads (you will).

13\. [The Lost Canadians](http://walrusmagazine.com/print/2011.01-history-the-lost-canadians/)

If you ever look at a map of America you'll notice the smooth border that is the 49th parallel and then [the little hiccup that is the Northwest Angle](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Northwest+Angle,+MN,+United+States&aq=1&sll=49.809632,-93.839722&sspn=2.385699,4.257202&ie=UTF8&hq=Northwest+Angle,+MN,+United+States&hnear=Northwest+Angle+Airport,+Minnesota+56711&ll=49.350177,-95.07019&spn=1.204129,2.128601&z=7). *The Walrus* investigates who these people are that live in this tiny sliver of America north of the 49th.

14\. [The Grand Tour](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/18/110418fa_fact_osnos?currentPage=all)

Last year when travelling, Wen and I couldn't help but notice the arrival of Chinese tourists. For this article, Evan Osnos of *The New Yorker* goes on a European tour with a contingent of the Chinese middle class. The story is about much more than 5 European countries in 10 days.

15\. [Heartbreak Hotel](http://www.chicagomag.com/core/pagetools.php?url=/Chicago-Magazine/August-2006/Heartbreak-Hotel/&mode=print)

The story of the Stevens Hotel (now the Hilton) in Chicago. That's the same Stevens as the recently retired supreme court judge.

16\. [Of Mines And Men](http://www.guernicamag.com/features/2575/johnson_4_15_11/)

More on the Chinese. This time how they're rebuilding Angola.
