Today was one of those magical days in New York where the light colours the city in unexpected ways. Â First, check out this dumpster that was transformed from banal into a battered modernist gem:

Later today I noticed the wind ripping through a nearby construction site, turing the steel skeleton into a giant lung:

Undoubtedly I'm being a little romantic, but this city never ceases to surprise...
