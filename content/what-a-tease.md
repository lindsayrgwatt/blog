A <a href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/16-06/st_3smartthings" target="_self">recent Wired article</a> cites the following:

> The pitches in musical scales are likely derived from language. Turns out, aspects of spoken English and Mandarin correlate to the intervals between notes in a chromatic scale (the black and white piano keys in an octave).

Unfortunately, there's nothing more than this offered as proof.  What a bold statement to make but then not back up.  Anyone out there know anything about this or where to get more details on this?
