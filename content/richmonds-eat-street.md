After a [recent article in Vancouver Magazine](http://www.vanmag.com/Restaurants/Best_of_Richmonds_Eat_Street) and a [press release about the best job ever](http://www.tourismrichmond.com/media/news-releases/tourism-richmond-holding-open-audition-salaried-year-long-food-blogger), I came to the stunning realization that I had completely missed out on the of the best areas in Vancouver to eat. Wen and I have spent the past year exploring the nooks and crannies of the city (witness [here](https://www.placeling.com/lindsayrgwatt/) and [here](http://lindsayrgwatt.com/blog/2011/03/food-walking-east-van/)) but I'd never heard of Richmond's own *Eat Street*Â - Alexandra Road:

Nestled between Aberdeen and Landsdowne sky train stations, it's an easy place to get to if you're car free like us.

In fact, the road's easy to miss; it's small and you certainly don't expect it to have one of the highest densities of Asian restaurants outside of, well, Asia. It's like a portal to Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore, all rolled into one - and without the humidity (And with awkwardly close overhead flights from the nearby airport; you'll know when a 777 takes off).

You're greeted with signs like the following:

So where to eat? There are so many options here that it would take a year to eat through them all (I guess that's why Richmond's looking for a food blogger). Some ideas:

- [Jade Seafood Restaurant](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f4d5b8a57b4e36b02000025): the best dim sum I've had yet in the city - and them's fighting words as Vancouver's got great dim sum
- [Kam Do Bakery](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f4d62d157b4e36b02000034): tried the taro and bean paste with walnut buns; delicieux
- [Viva City](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f544c9757b4e33a7300000a): it was a toss-up to go here or Jade. Next time, next time
- [MaxNoodle House](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f4d62a257b4e36b0200002d) (formerly McNoodle; can't imagine why they changed it): I'm coming back for a noodle tour and am going to hit this place up
- [Cattle Cafe](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f5bd43557b4e32187000012): 2pm and a lineup out the door
- [Deer Noodle Soups](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f544c4157b4e33a73000003): $8 noodle soup can't go wrong
- [Nan Chuu Japanese Izakaya](http://www.placeling.com/perspectives/4f5bd5c457b4e3218700001b): I'm a sucker for Izakayas and this one looked like tasty and boozy fun

There are also a tonne of karaoke bars on the street. At the end, in the cul de sac is what looks like Science World on steroids. I love the notion of "All you can sign" karaoke:

I'm going to be going back frequently; expect more updates. And [follow me on Placeling](http://www.placeling.com/lindsayrgwatt/) to get all the above-mentioned places and my notes on them on your phone.
