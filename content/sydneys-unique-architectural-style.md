Sydney has its own style - of architecture that is.  This post is going to be about architecture-I'll save a bitchy [Mr. Blackwell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blackwell)-style rant on some of the bad fashion I've seen here for later.

It's not just monuments like the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House, rather there are a few neighbourhoods with a distinct local style.  Both [Glebe](http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/GLE/GLE.htm) and Paddington consists of houses that look like Victorian London was transported to the tropics.  The houses come in two types: two story row houses with iron work...

Most of the buildings were built in the 1880's and they give the neighbourhoods great character (and now sell for millions...).  Here are a couple of examples of the detail in that ironwork:
