Do you have an alcoholic Russian (or Russian-loving friend) who is filthy rich and you're struggling to find a gift for them?  Maybe they own a football or basketball team and already have a chateau in the French countryside.  Fortunately, the good folks at [Astor Wines](http://www.astorwines.com/) understand your challenges and offer [Imperial Collection Faberge Egg](http://www.astorwines.com/SearchResultsSingle.aspx?search=21103&searchtype=Contains&term=Imperial,Collection,Faberge,Blue,White&p=2):

Your oligarch awaits his gift.
