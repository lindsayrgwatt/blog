I just finished listening to [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org)'s story on [The Giant Pool of Money](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=355) a.k.a. how the subprime mortgage fiasco became the credit crunch.  It's a fascinating story, made all the more real by their "man on the street" interviews.  I highly recommend listening to it so you can get a taste of the ridiculous excess that led to where we are today.
