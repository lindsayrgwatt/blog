Unless you live under a rock, you probably know that the Celtics blew away the Lakers in Game 6 of the NBA finals to win their 17th championship - and first in 22 years.

A lot has been made about the structure of the team and how management built a team around the three stars of Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen.  What's equally interesting is what goes on away from the parquet.  The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB121218623895933915.html" target="_self">team is owned by a syndicate of 25 financiers</a>, mostly venture capitalists and private equity veterans.

What does this mean?  Well, they're fiercely competitive but also metrics driven.  Maybe that's why they [crunch the numbers on every datapoint they can get about their competition](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/magazine/04wwln-freakonomics-t.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all) and essentially model how the team should react to different teams and players.

You're never going to win in sport without great players - but great players alone aren't going to beat a team that hustles this hard off the court.
