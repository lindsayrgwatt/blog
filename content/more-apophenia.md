I just finished reading [William Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/)'s [Pattern Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_Recognition_(novel)). (As with all things Gibsonian, I highly recommend it).  One of the concepts that comes up throughout it is apophenia. For those unfamiliar with the term, here's the [Wikipedia definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia) (with examples):

> Apophenia is the experience of seeing patterns or connections in random or meaningless data.

This made it all the more ironic for me when I read this sentence in the book this morning, pertaining to an email where a character talks about a plane he has found during a dig on the steppes outside Stalingrad/Volgograd:

> It's a whole plane and for some fucking reason it wound up under four feet of muck, but this Guru character knew where it was. He claims its dreams and visions but I think he walks around in the winter with a metal detector. So he'd said here, this plane is here, dig, and before we came back to London they'd sunk a trench and hit it. But bribery and threats prevailed, at least till we got back with the extra cameras and crew, because I wanted this plane emerging to be the climax of the film. No idea it would be a Stuka; blew me away; it's just this most Nazi-looking aircraft, amazing. Dive-bomber, they used them on the Spanish, *Guernica* and that.

Now, pivot to a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/08/books/08creative.html?pagewanted=all) I'm reading just a few minutes later, recommended by someone I follow on Twitter:

> Grab a timer and set it for one minute. Now list as many creative uses for a brick as you can imagine. Go.
>
> The question is part of a classic test for creativity, a quality that scientists are trying for the first time to track in the brain.
>
> They hope to figure out precisely which biochemicals, electrical impulses and regions were used when, say, Picasso painted “[Guernica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(painting)),” or Louise Nevelson assembled her wooden sculptures.

I love it. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for his life. Teach a man about apophenia and he'll see meaningless connections everywhere.
