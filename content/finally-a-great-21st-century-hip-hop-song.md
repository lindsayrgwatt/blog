I love hip hop. Actually, let me qualify that - I like hip hop that tells a story, preferably with a heavy slice of social commentary. The best hip hop songs let us into a world that we otherwise would never see or provide some social commentary that let us see society in a different way.

In the 70s, 80s and 90s, these sort of songs abounded: [The Message](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4o8TeqKhgY). [Fight The Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PaoLy7PHwk).  [C.R.E.A.M.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjZRAvsZf1g) [It Was A Good Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWfbGGZE07M). And one of the best written and most ambitious concepts ever: Nas' [One Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTyQfABqwdo).

Unfortunately, in the mid-90's, hip hop became really commercially successful and instead we got mindless drivel like [It's All About The Benjamins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWrE6DP86hc) and more recently [Roll Call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktdFm7xNJow). These songs might get people on the dance floor, but you won't be listening to them five years after they're written.

In fact, the only song with any soul that might have come out this century was probably [Hate It Or Love It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuMBmK5uksg).  What's more, is I've found myself wondering how we could have just gone through the worst economic crisis in generations and there hasn't been one hip hopper who's written a song about it. After all, this was originally protest music, and there's a lot to protest these days!

Thankfully, there's finally a hip hop song that captures all the confusion of these past few years. Unfortunately, [the original version is almost unlistenable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FT0-GdA4Ss) - despite it's great lyrics - but a few weeks ago it was repackaged in a fantastic form.

What song am I talking about? Dizzee Rascal's Dirtee Cash performed as a mash-up with Florence + The Machine's You've Got The Love at the 2010 Brit Awards:

The lyrics to this song are awesome. Dizzee spits them so fast that you might not notice them at first, so give them a read here - especially verse 3 - and reflect on why no one else is singing about this today:

> \[Dizzee Rascal\]  
> Let’s go  
> Everybody wants to be famous,  
> Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless,  
> People act shameless  
> Tryna live like entertainers,  
> Want a fat crib with the acres,  
> So they spend money that they ain’t made yet,  
> Got a Benz on tik that they ain’t paid yet,  
> Spend their pay cheque  
> In the West End on the weekend  
> Got no money by the end of the weekend.  
> But they don’t care cause their life is a movie,  
> Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly,  
> Truthfully, it’s a joke, like a bad episode of Hollyoaks,  
> Can’t keep up with the cover notes,  
> So they got bad credit livin’ on direct debit in debt  
> they still don’t get  
> Cause they too busy livin’ the high life, the night life  
> Huggin’ the high when livin’ it large  
> And they all say
>
> \[Florence\]  
> Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough  
> And things go wrong no matter what I do  
> Now and then it seems that life is just too much  
> But you’ve got the love I need to see me through
>
> \[Dizzee Rascal - Verse 2\]  
> Let me take you down to London city  
> Where the attitude’s bad and the weather is shitty  
> Everybody’s on a paper chase  
> It’s one big rat race  
> Everybody's got a screw face  
> So many 2 face,  
> Checkin their high just like their ready to ride  
> I’m on the inside looking at the outside  
> So it’s an accurate reflection  
> City wide, north, east, west and the southside  
> Everywhere I go there’s a goon on the corner  
> Guns and drugs cause the city’s like a sauna  
> And it’s getting warmer, and out of order  
> Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner  
> Mr politician can you tell me the solution  
> What’s the answer, what’s the conclusion  
> Is it an illusion, is it a mirage  
> I see young’n’s die because they tryna live large  
> And they all say
>
> \[Florence\]  
> Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air  
> I know I can count on all of you  
> Sometimes I feel like saying “Lord I just don’t care”  
> But you’ve got the love I need to see me through  
> (Check it, check it, come on, come on)
>
> \[Chorus\]  
> You got the love  
> (Who’s got the love)  
> You got the love  
> (Who’s got the love)  
> You got the love  
> (That’s right, thats right, thats right)  
> You got the love  
> You got the love  
> You got the love
>
> \[Dizzee Rascal - Verse 3\]  
> We are living in the days of the credit crunch  
> Give me the dough  
> I’m tryna have a bunch  
> But I cant have rice for lunch  
> Its not there ain't enough to share  
> It ain't fair never dreamed that he could be rare  
> Who cares who dares to make a change  
> Everybody in the club trying to make it rain  
> But not for famine just for the sake of having  
> 15 minutes of fame and everywhere’s the same  
> Again and again I see the same thing  
> Everybody acting like they their plane sailin’  
> I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession  
> And then a depression in whatever professon  
> This is my confession I can’t front I’m in the forefront  
> Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump  
> With no rope but I ain’t trying to see the bottom  
> Because thats where I came from, I ain’t forgotten,  
> \[Chorus\]  
> \[End\]
