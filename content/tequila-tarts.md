Yesterday was Valentine's Day, and in addition to these flowers:

Wendy was also the recipient of a set of [Petit Fours](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_fours) and truffles from [Three Tarts](http://www.3tarts.com/) (they get bonus points for lavender- and chili-flavoured truffles):

I also made her a dinner of [tequila lime chicken with cilantro dressing](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tequila-lime-chicken-with-cilantro-dressing-recipe/index.html).  There's a secretly nerdy reason why I made it - I was at a vendor conference on Thursday and they showed that page as an example of their technology; I thought the recipe looked great and so we made it.  It's a great dish and very light - just be aware that the prep time is massive (you've got to make the oil and plucking leaves off of cilantro ain't the easiest thing...).

Valentine's Day was almost perfect - the only snag was that we went out to Bushwick for a party, only to get there and find out that it had been shut down by the police.  On the plus side, we taught our cab driver how to navigate the backwoods of Brooklyn...
