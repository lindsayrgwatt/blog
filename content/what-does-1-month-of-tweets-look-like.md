There are no shortage of visualization tools to help you understand your tweet stream. I'd like to add another one: the paper trail.

For the past month I've been printing my tweets. It's an experiment and an admittedly narcissistic pursuit.

Here's what makes the magic happen; it's an [Adafruit Internet of Things Printer](https://www.adafruit.com/products/717):

It's a thermal printer that's connected to the Net. It pings [search.twitter.com](http://search.twitter.com) and find every time I tweet.

After a month that's a roll of paper that stretched twenty feet along my floor:

<img src="{static}/images/2012/11/IMG_3632.jpg" class="photo" width="500" height="385" alt="1 month of tweets" />

<img src="{static}/images/2012/11/IMG_3633.jpg" class="photo" width="500" height="593" alt="1 month of tweets" />

Another perspective comes from hanging it from the ceiling:

<div style="text-align: center;">

<img src="{static}/images/2012/11/IMG_3629.jpg" class="photo" width="183" height="500" alt="1 month of tweets" />

</div>

Here's a close-up of a tweet:

<img src="{static}/images/2012/11/IMG_3631.jpg" class="photo" width="500" height="333" alt="1 month of tweets" />

This is stunningly banal stuff. Any individual tweet does not conjure up a heckuva lot of emotion (particularly the auto-tweeted ones). Yet, when you see twenty feet of them, there's something interesting about it.
