So I went away for the weekend and [someone in my neighbourhood was murdered](http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5709727&page=1).  However, before you panic, you can rest as the suspect is in custody.  In fact, he's being interviewed right now.  This is the scene outside [Precinct 10](http://home2.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/precincts/precinct_010.shtml):

You can't tell from this photo, but there are in fact six tv vans plus another one circling the block.  It's an absolute zoo...
