Back in January, the New Yorker had a great article [reviewing the state of the modern Arabic novel](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/01/18/100118crbo_books_pierpont).  It's worth reading as, I'm guessing that, like me, you know absolutely nothing about Arabic novels - and there's *a lot* to know (and a lot of it is very subtle).

If you want to skip the article, I created an [Amazon Wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2OF9G60EFKG8Z?reveal=all&filter=all&sort=universal-title&layout=standard&x=20&y=13) where you can see all the books.  As  I was building the wishlist, I noticed an interesting phenomena.  These books are almost always bought together.  Take a look at the screenshot below.  All seven of those books are in the list:

I wonder if these were always bought together or if the New Yorker article caused them to be clustered together.  Ah, the magic of Amazon and collaborative filtering...
