Every now and then I come across a piece of software that makes me think "damn, that's cool."  Most recently, I've been playing with [thumber](http://www.threewordtitle.com/thumber/).  It's a simple premise: feed it a Quicktime .mov and it turns it into a post of thumbnails.  Nothing more, nothing less - and the results are beautiful.

Check out the video for Birds by Vitalic:

Here's what it looks like after being run through thumber:

Awesome stuff.

PS If you like the movie, check out [more by Pleix](http://www.pleix.net/films.html).  I especially like *Sometimes.*
