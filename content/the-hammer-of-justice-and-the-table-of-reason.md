I recently finished a four day/12 hour introductory woodworking class at Bushwick (ahem, *East Williamsburg's*) [3rd Ward](http://www.3rdward.com/) (one of the few URLs to actually contain a number).  In it, we made a mallet and an end table - but that doesn't sound that exciting, hence "The Hammer of Justice" and "The Table of Reason".

Here's a shot of the completed works:

I highly recommend taking a course like this, if you get the chance.  It's deeply satisfying to work with your hands and end up with a physical object afterwards as proof of what you did (I'm not alone in this, witness the popularity of [MAKE magazine](http://makezine.com/)).

3rd Ward is also a great place to take a class: they've great equipment, the instructors are incredibly approachable, small class sizes plus they get you 'creating' right away.  Our first class involved a lot of cutting on different saws (mitre, table, band, etc.) and at the end of the class we had a finished mallet.  There's nothing like having a completed work to convince you that you can succeed at the task and make you hungry to try something more complex.
