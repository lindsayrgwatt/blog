Much has been made about [Google Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz) and [it's privacy issues](http://www.businessinsider.com/warning-google-buzz-has-a-huge-privacy-flaw-2010-2).  However, for me, it's totally paid off for me.  Last week an old friend posted some pictures of the cherry blossoms in DC; I commented and he invited us down for the weekend.  How could we say no (especially since Wen had never been).

Here are some photos; you can easily guess what we did.  We started off on the Mall:

Here are some shots of those cherry trees; in fact, it turned out that it was the [National Cherry Blossom Festival](http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/).

Here are some shots of the different memorials that dot the Mall.  Jefferson:

Lincoln.  Very popular photo spot:

The Vietnam War Memorial:

After that it was off to the White House:

Day two was spent in Georgetown (after a night that saw a delicious dinner at [Oyamel](http://www.oyamel.com/) and drinks at [Bourbon](http://www.bourbondc.com/)).  I didn't realize that [The Exorcist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070047/) was shot there (and written by a Georgetown grad); here are the classic stairs:

Here are some shots of buildings in the neighbourhood:

<img src="{static}/images/2010/04/IMG_0109.jpg" title="Row Houses in Georgetown" class="aligncenter size-full " width="500" height="358" />This is where Kennedy lived when he was a senator:

<img src="{static}/images/2010/04/IMG_0098.jpg" title="Healy Hall, Georgetown" class="aligncenter size-full " width="500" height="314" />We also made it to [The Phillips Collection](http://www.phillipscollection.org/), which is [reputed to be one the best small museums](http://www.moreintelligentlife.com/content/economistcom/phillips-collection-ars-domestica) and lived up to it.  They had a brilliant Georgia O'Keeffe exhibit which included these ones:

*Red, Yellow and Black Streak*, 1924:

*Music-Pink and Blue No. 1*:

*Grey Lines with Black, Blue and Yellow* - 1923/25:

and White Sweet Peas - 1926:

Also, they've got a few beauties in their permanent collection.  Here's one that caught my eye.  It's [Stefan Hirsch](http://www.askart.com/askart/h/stefan_a_hirsch/stefan_a_hirsch.aspx)'s *New York Lower Manhattan* (1921):

Also, [Rockwell Kent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_Kent)'s *The Road Rollers* (1909).  A very different way of plowing the snow:
