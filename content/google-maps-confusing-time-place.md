One of the most incredible pieces of software developed in the past few years in Google Street View. The notion that you can use your computer to see what a neighborhood looks like is literally magic. What's more, you can virtually drive through the neighborhood, experiencing it like a local.

I mean, a person had to drive a car to take that photo, a machine had to stitch all those photos together and it's now available to you anywhere you can get a decent web connection.

The mind boggles.

What's even more mind boggling to me is that sometimes your linear trip down the street turns into a trip down memory lane. As you seamlessly slide your "drive" from place to place along the street you suddenly find yourself whisked through time. Drivers change, leaves fall off trees - but more interestingly, sometimes entire cityscapes change.

A building disappears and its replacement reappears or you change an angle and suddenly there's a construction site.

This happened to me recently looking at [New York's Astor Place](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=Astor+Place%2C+NYC%2C+NY&data=!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x89c2599bb1beab97%3A0x9434cad8e9358d95!3m8!1m3!1d731!2d-73.991291!3d40.729913!3m2!1i1272!2i743!4f13.1!4m2!3d40.72983!4d-73.9914232).

I wanted to see the new building that's going to house IBM's Watson group. Here is it, looking from Astor Place & Lafayette:

[<img src="{static}/images/2014/01/watson_building-500x234.png" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="500" height="234" alt="Watson Building" />]({static}/images/2014/01/watson_building.png)I drove my virtual car across Lafayette so that I could get a closer look:

[<img src="{static}/images/2014/01/missing_building-500x234.png" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="500" height="234" alt="Missing Building" />]({static}/images/2014/01/missing_building.png)

But wait; what building is that? That yellow building wasn't there a second ago...

Let's drive a bit further and look backwards:

[<img src="{static}/images/2014/01/watson_building_construction-500x233.png" class="aligncenter size-medium " width="500" height="233" alt="Watson Building Under Construction" />]({static}/images/2014/01/watson_building_construction.png)Time has shifted yet again and now we see the building under construction.

On the one hand the techie in me thinks there's nothing interesting here: Google's servers will update their imagery over time and eventually become consistent.

The romantic in me likes to imagine a scenario where the algorithm occasionally burps and historical images begin to appear when you least expect them. 25 years from now you're trying to find a place on the map when suddenly a long-vanished building appears only to disappear when you turn the virtual vehicles view.

Or perhaps there's a new feature that turns Google Maps into a virtual version of Ed Ruscha'sÂ *All The Buildings on the Sunset Strip.*

He's been going back every few years to the strip to update the photos but now Google will have done it globally on a regular basis. You'll literally have a map of all places in the world for regular intervals since 2005.
