I live in New York City, where you can't go more than about 150 feet without hitting a road.  I'm from Canada where you can go up to the North and there are no roads for at least a hundred kilometers (see my earlier post on the ice fields in Auyuittuq park).  So what about the U.S.?  How far can you go before you hit a road?

Turns out, not that far.  According to [this article,](http://209.85.215.104/search?q=cache:kos7rbhTutUJ:blog.sciencenews.org/mathtrek/2007/05/miles_from_nowhere.html%20longest%20distance%20from%20a%20road%20in%20contiguous%20us&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us&client=firefox-a) the farthest you can go in landlocked America is 20 miles, and it's in the southeastern corner of Yellowstone:
