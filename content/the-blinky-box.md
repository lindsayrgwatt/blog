Last year this [awesome story](http://www.nycresistor.com/2013/07/05/programmable-toys-blinky-box/) by [Miria Grunick](http://blog.grunick.com/) appeared in one of my feeds. I was immediately inspired to create one for Cam and this year I finally built him his very ownÂ [Blinky Box](http://blog.grunick.com/blinky-box/).

I made a few changes to her design: a switch in the upper left toggles a solid color vs. flashing lights mode. Plus the knob in the upper right rapidly changes the frequency of flashing.

I had the top laser cut as I have no idea how to cut a plastic box. (If you're in Seattle, get it done at [Metrix Create Space](http://www.metrixcreatespace.com/) so you can watch them do it - and it only costs $7 or so)

Here's a video of it in action:

If you want to make your own, the code's on [Github](https://github.com/lindsayrgwatt/blinkybox); feel free to fork as it's definitely not optimal. I also included the .SVG for the laser cutting; I recommend making the holes for the arcade buttons a little bigger as mine stick - 0.5mm should be enough.

You can get the bill of materials on [Miria's Github repo](https://github.com/miria/BlinkyBox); if you make my version you'll also need a switch.

For anyone who tries it and gets stuck, here are some photos of some of the major breadboarded items. Should be enough to get you over any hump:
