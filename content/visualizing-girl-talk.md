No, this post is not going to have anything to do with girls.  Rather, it's about [Gregg Gillis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Talk_(musician)) a.k.a. Girl Talk.  His latest album, [Feed The Animals](http://74.124.198.47/illegal-art.net/__girl__talk___feed__the__anima.ls___/), is a sampling assault.  Each song jumps from sample to sample at an amazingly frantic rate; it's been on my iPod for weeks now and I can't get enough.  It's music for people with ADD (if you like it, I recommend [Arthur King](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=51303508)'s [Pop Sh!t](http://www.lindsayrgwatt.com/archives/old_blog/24_Perfect_Hip-Pop_Music.html)).

The challenge with his music - and any sample-based music in general - is trying to explain it to anyone who's never heard anything like it.  Fortunately, the good folks at Wired magazine are up for the challenge.  Check out [this visualization of one of his tracks](http://www.wired.com/special_multimedia/2008/pl_music_1609); you can find it in the latest issue (16.09):
