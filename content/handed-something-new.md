I had an interesting experience the other day while shopping for groceries: I discovered a new fruit.  I'm not talking about some mild variation on apples (golden honey crisp granny smith...), rather something mind-blowing that I'd never seen before - the [Buddha's Hand citron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha%27s_hand).  The thing looks like a yellow octopus; here's a shot of Wendy pretending to eat it:

I thought I new just about every interesting fruit out there, but this one was a pleasant suprise - until we tried eating it.  The darn thing tasted like a pithy lemon with little flavour.  I'm going to put it in the same category as [Dragon Fruit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitaya): stunning until bitten into.
