Guo Fengyi, a Chinese artist who passed away in 2010, is not a well-known artist, to the point that she does not even have a Wikipedia entry. This is completely undeserved and hopefully will be rectified after her recent exhibit at Vancouver's [Contemporary Art Gallery](http://www.contemporaryartgallery.ca).

Born in 1942, she spent most of her life *not*Â creating art. Then, one day she fell sick and started to practice traditional *qi-qong* medicine. This led her to visions that compelled her to draw. Her work was largely unnoticed until 2002 when she exhibited with the [Long March Project](http://www.longmarchproject.com/GUOfengyi/2009-07/about-e.html).

Her work is all similar in style and fascinating to look at. All her works are paper drawings, frequently on scrolls, and using simple colours. Everything is a flat line drawing; there's no attempt at shading or perspective. She hints at traditional chinese motifs and beliefs.

The scale of the work is overwhelming; some pieces tower fifteen feet over you.

You're not supposed to take photos, but I did. Here are a few:
