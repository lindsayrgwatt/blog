When we visited Laos, I couldn't help but wonder if it was so (relatively) poor due to its status as a landlocked country.

So I put together the following graphs comparing [PPP Adjusted GDP per Capita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) (IMF or CIA number if IMF not available) for [all countries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_continent) that are not islands (my hypothesis is that they develop differently than continental countries-different political/environmental pressures, etc.) and at least 1,000 sq kilometer in size. I've coloured the graphs based on whether the [countries are landlocked or not](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlocked_country). I've skipped North America as there are no landlocked countries.

The results are pretty clear; on average, you're worse off economically if you're from a landlocked country.

5 of the 10 poorest countries are landlocked; 11 of the poorest 20. Only 1 of the richest 10 and 2 of the richest 20 are landlocked.

5 of the 10 poorest and none of the 10 richest.

<font size="5"><span style="font-size: 18px;">**Europe**</span></font>

The most even of the bunch. Only 3 of the 10 poorest and 3 of the 10 richest. However, you could argue that Austria wasn't landlocked for most of its existence (due to the Holy Roman Empire) and than Luxembourg is a statistical outlier due to its small size.

It's left as an exercise to the reader to interpret the chart below.
