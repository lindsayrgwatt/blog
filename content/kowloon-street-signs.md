One of the unique features of Hong Kong - and Kowloon (where we stayed) in particular - are the street signs. They're ubiquitous and they hang over the streets, offering each store's wares.

You can almost think of them as parasites that anchor on the sides of buildings and try to drown out the sky from locals underneath.

The fact that they're in an inscrutable language makes them enjoyable; I'm sure if I could read them (Restaurant! Cheap clothes!), the allure would be lost.
