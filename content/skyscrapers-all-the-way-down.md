Hong Kong's buildings are like plants in the jungle. All of them compete skyward for a limited swath of sun. It makes the city very imposing:

Occasionally, the apartment buildings are actually fighting with the jungle:

While imposing, when you get a chance to admire it from afar, it's quite the effect:
