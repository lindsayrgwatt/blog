A few weeks back it was abnormally cold here in NYC (global warming has made us wimps) and my friend Richard and I were speculating where the coldest livable place was.  Richard, being from South Africa, thought that perhaps Duluth, MN was the coldest place on Earth.  I countered with Iqualuit, Nunavut.  Much colder.

However, Richard, not to be outdone, diligently went away and spent a few days trying to see if he could find anywhere to trump it...and he did.  [Yakutsk, Siberia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakutsk).  Words cannot describe how cold this place is, but a photo can.  Here's the weather forecast from a few days back:

Richard - you win.
