Characters (line drawings, not humans) are everywhere in Japan. They've been around for a long time - artists like [Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa_Kuniyoshi) used to put crazy animals in his drawings to get around censors:

More recently, they've been redone to be more *[kawaii](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuteness_in_Japanese_culture)* , a term that loosely translates as 'cute'.

Needless to say, the Japanese never use a picture or words where a cute character could be placed instead.

Here are a couple of government posters:

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0956.jpg" width="500" height="702" alt="Anti-Motorcycle Theft Sign" />

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0975.jpg" width="500" height="352" alt="Car crossing sign" />

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0611.jpg" width="500" height="537" alt="Construction worker character" />

This also goes for products as well:

There are also many products that are sold on the basis of an anthropomorphized character. This one's roach-be-gone:

Orange juice:

While we're at it, why not make construction site pylons into cute characters too?

Every single instructional sign should include at least one cute character if at all possible:

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0960.jpg" width="500" height="163" alt="No dog poop sign" />

This one's just baffling:

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0881.jpg" width="500" height="872" alt="Baffling smoke sign" />

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0750.jpg" width="500" height="516" alt="Stop smoking character" />

Cops have pretty characters for their dogs:

And even your local bus has a character:

Hell, you want some pork for dinner? How about this cute and tasty little guy?

In fact, tonight when I sleep I think I'll be dreaming of characters. Maybe one of the ones from this crazy wall outside the Takadanobaba subway station:

<img src="{static}/images/2010/07/IMG_0570.jpg" width="500" height="263" alt="Characters on wall near Takadanobaba Station" />
