Today I read the [most recent entry in Strange Maps](http://strangemaps.wordpress.com/2008/12/27/350-accidental-cartography-between-cartocacoethes-and-blatant-pareidolia/), talking about humans tend to see things where they don't really exist (read their blog entry for some great photos).  There's a technical word for this - [apophenia](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/apophenia).

The best part of reading this article is that it [anchored](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring) me to start seeing patterns where none existed.  I didn't have to wait too long until it finally happened.  I was listening to a recent [Resident Advisor podcast](http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=136) and it contained the following album art:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/01/ra136-the-orb.jpg" title="Orb Painting" class="aligncenter size-full " width="312" height="400" alt="Orb Painting" />I immediately thought that it looked exactly like part of the path from Bow Lake up to the [Wapta Icefield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapta_Icefield):

<img src="{static}/images/2009/01/wapta-top.jpg" title="Way to Wapta Ice Field" class="aligncenter size-full " width="400" height="192" alt="Way to Wapta Ice Field" />Now, Resident Advisor is based in Sydney and the podcast is from a British group, so I'm pretty sure that nobody involved with it has ever been to Wapta.  Must be that apophenia kicking in...
