Personally, I've never really wanted to be [Tom Cruise](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/) - with the exception of two moments.  The first was when he was rocketing around in an F-14 Tomcat in [Top Gun](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092099/).  The second was when he got to play with that really cool interface in [Minority Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/) (and yes, I'm aware that this makes me a total geek):

I've known that if you get wealthy enough you can always buy a jet fighter (Larry Ellison and his son have mock dogfights over the Pacific), but how about that interface?

Today I found out that it might be coming a little sooner than the jet, thanks to [Oblong Industries](http://oblong.com/).  Check out this video of their [G-Speak "spatial operating environment"](http://vimeo.com/2229299).  Then you can compare it with the [original Minority Report user interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwVBzx0LMNQ).
