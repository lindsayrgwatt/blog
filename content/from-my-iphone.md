This post is coming at you from my iPhone. It's amazing: you download an app and seconds later you're blogging. I really feel like I'm holding the future in my hand (check put how you can take a photo and include it in the post). I'll blog more about this when I get a chance, bit right now I'm enjoying my phone too much.
