I've noticed three interesting things in New York over the past few weeks.

1\) I don't get nearly as much junk mail as I used to.  In fact, a few days this week I've had no mail at all (don't know if that should make me happy or sad).  My guess is that the credit card companies are cutting down on their marketing budgets to keep profits high.

2\) There are a bunch of billboards for rent near me - including a couple down in the meatpacking district that are about as good as they get for location.

3\) They just can't seem to lease space in Chelsea Market right now.  There are a bunch of shops that have gone under and not been replaced.

These are anecdotes, and the <a href="http://www.feld.com/blog/archives/2007/09/the_plural_of_a.html" target="_self">plural of anecdote is not data</a>, but is America's "recession that isn't" finally coming to NYC?
