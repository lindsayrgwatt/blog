I was recently reading an article in a magazine and it mentioned a place I had never heard of: [Siachen Glacier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siachen_Glacier).  As an avid backcountry skier I have a soft spot for glaciers, but I was shocked as I learned about this one.

It turns out that Siachen runs through a hotly disputed part of Kashmir and has been the site of battles between India and Pakistan for 25 years now.  Was is horrible to begin with, but a battle on this glacier takes depravity to a whole new level.  The glacier sits between 11 and 18 thousand feet above sea level.  At that height you barely breathe let alone fight.  It is routinely -50 degrees and avalanches and crevasses are a constant danger.  Moreover, your food is constantly frozen (as is your rifle) and you're at constant risk of pulmonary edema.  It is probably the worst place on earth to be a soldier.

Equally tragic is that both India and Pakistan are turning this area into a giant ecological tragedy.  The area is littered with the waste of 25 years worth of thousands of soldiers.  Apparently it's making the glacier melt faster than it should.

I highly recommend reading [this New York Times article](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807EFDA1431F930A15756C0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&scp=1&sq=&pagewanted=all); there's more in [this Outside article](http://outside.away.com/outside/features/200302/200302_siachen_1.html).  To help you struggle with the geographical beauty and human horror, here are some photos from the region:
