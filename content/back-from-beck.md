Wen and I just got back from watching [Beck](http://www.myspace.com/beck) at the [United Palace Theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Palace_Theater) (a unique venue if ever there was one).  I hadn't seen him for over ten years \[insert cheesy quote about how we've both aged, but the music hasn't\] and the sound's a bit different now.  A lot more rocking (my ears will be ringing for a few days) and a bit less hip-hop.

He still has the ability to surprise.  Halfway through the show the whole band ditched their instruments and beatboxed a few songs on stage.  After that it was some folk and a bit of country.  Other than that, it was pretty rocking with a lot of rock-ey remixes of the popular faves.

Here's a photo for those of you who won't be making it:
