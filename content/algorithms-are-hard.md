Yesterday I was listening to a podcast that referenced [Cajmere's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Jones) *Coffee Pot* - commonly referred to as "Percolator" or "It's time for the percolator".  I was wondering how the original song went, so I figured I'd listen to in on YouTube.

All good, but check out that "featured video" in the upper right corner.  I'm guessing that YouTube noticed that people who looked at this video looked at that video - and therefore I might want to as well.  But rest assured, I have little desire to copulate with animals.

Recommendation algorithms are hard, and this one's not working yet.
