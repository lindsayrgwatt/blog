I just finished reading [The Tawqacores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taqwacores) (*taqwa* = piety) by [Michael Muhammed Knight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Muhammad_Knight).  The book is referred to [The Catcher in the Rye for muslims](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/23/us/23muslim.html?_r=4&hp).  It was fascinating to read an ex-Catholic Muslim convert try and lay out his view of what Islam could be and use punk as a metaphor to do so.  (The book is only 256 pages so rather than my discussing it further, just go read a copy)

The book is also notable for it's extensive name-checking of punk bands with a little bit of hip-hop and ska/reggae thrown in.  Here, thanks to my Kindle (which makes this sort of note-taking trivial), is a list of all the mentioned songs.  Feel free to use it as a way to determine if it's worth reading:
