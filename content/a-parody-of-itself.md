New York has great coffee and great cafe culture.  You name it: [Cafe Grumpy](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-grumpy-brooklyn), [Ninth Street Espresso](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ninth-street-espresso-new-york-3), [Abraco](http://www.abraconyc.com/) - the places hum with activity.  However, sometimes they can be a bit much.

On the weekend, Wen and I went out to Grumpy's original Greenpoint location to take in the neighbourhood and an arts and crafts fair (I picked up some carrot habanero sauce and pumpkin butter; very unexpected).  I couldn't help but notice this group working away in the corner:

What you've got there are four people, all with identical MacBooks.  Each is plugging away and completely oblivious to each other.  A bit of a parody of a twentysomething working in a coffee shop...
