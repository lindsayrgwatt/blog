Continuing this summer's Gulf Islands theme, a few weeks back Wen and I went to [Hornby Island](http://www.hornbyisland.com/). It's a spectacular place:

It's also a place where the '60s never died. Aging hippies sell $4 lattes and $3 baked samosas in the local market and then retreat to their $800,000 beach homes:

The little touches are the best. The "elder parking" at the co-op:

â€¦or the "green roof" on the gas station:

Places like the following abound:

If you search, you can find the requisite [geodesic dome house](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome):

It's a beautiful place, albeit a place that takes itself a little too seriously. But then, that's what makes it so charming.
