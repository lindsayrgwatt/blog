One of the joys of traveling is trying all the local cuisine. Wen and I took a cooking class in Luang Prabang Laos to get a sense of what food the local's eat. (The class was at Tamnak Lao; very easy to find)

The class started with a visit to local Phoisy market to see what the local ingredients look like in bulk:

One of the local cooking sauces is *Padak*; it's made from rotting fish so you can imagine what it smells like. It's being gradually replaced with shrimp paste.

People buy this minced pork wrapped in banana leaves; it's a poor man's refrigerator.

Here's a quick rundown on what we cooked:

*Luang Prabang Salad* - that's minced chicken drizzled in mayo; beneath the veggies are salad leaves and watercress

*Feu Khua* - fried sticky rice noodles with chicken and vegetables. You fry the vermicelli and toss an egg in to create a pancake. You then chop it up, remove it from the heat and add it back to the rest of the ingredients after you've cooked them:

*Chicken Larp:*

*Luang Prabang Jeowbong* - a sweet and spicy but not hot chili paste:

It was a great day. Here's chef Wendy with some of her creations:
