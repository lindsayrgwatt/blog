Today Wen and I went to [Governors Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governors_Island) (yes, that's no apostrophe). It's a unique place: picture a combination of old Coast Guard base, now abandoned; an ancient fort, fantastic views of the city and lots of art.

Moreover, t[he future of the island is still being debated](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/design/13governor.html), but you can be sure that it won't look like what it currently does. Â So here are some photos of what it looks like today.

### Scenery

The island has stunning views of the city. I loved seeing the Brooklyn docks as looking out my window, I have the exact opposite views:

### Buildings

As mentioned, the island if full of buildings, most of them abandoned.

### Plants

With so many abandoned buildings, the plant life is pretty lush by New York standards.

### Textures

The island sits in the middle of the harbour and gets pounded by the elements. Rich textures abound

And finally, when we visited, the island was littered with art installations
