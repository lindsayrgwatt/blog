Last night Rich and I went to see [LTJ Bukem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTJ_Bukem) and MC Conrad at Club Love.  It's one of my favourite places to see a dj in NYC - a bit dive-y, great sound system and a totally unpretentious crowd:

The other great thing about Love is there light show.  They've got human-powered lasers: a woman literally fires a laser through a set of prisms to create the visual effect she wants.  Definitely a job that I never would have guessed existed:

Here are a couple more snaps:
