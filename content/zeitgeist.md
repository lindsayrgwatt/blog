I snapped this photo today as I watched this nutter outside the now-closed Balducci's at 8th and 14th.Â  I don't know why, but I thought he kind of captured the moment:

<img src="{static}/images/2009/04/img_0065-300x246.jpg" title="Nutter on 8th" class="size-medium  aligncenter" width="300" height="246" alt="Nutter on 8th" />
