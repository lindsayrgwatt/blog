Inspired by the New York Times' *36 Hours In...* series, Wen and I recently ducked down to Seattle.

I love visiting Seattle because it's a city that is absolutely unlike Vancouver despite the proximity; going there truly feels like a different world.

It was a great weekend: lots of walking, eating, taking photos, exploring and drinking coffee.

Here are some photo highlights.

**Spring was in bloom**

**Public Art Abounds**

**<img src="{static}/images/2011/04/IMG_9545.jpg" width="480" height="336" alt="Richard Serra sculptures" />**

A few Richard Serra's at the sculpture park...

The most dynamic art is graffiti on building scaffolding

**Lots of Modern Architecture**

City Hall

**<span style="font-weight: normal;">The Hyatt</span>

The library

**You Have To Visit The Market**

**<img src="{static}/images/2011/04/IMG_9514.jpg" width="480" height="320" alt="Seattle Public Market" />**

**<img src="{static}/images/2011/04/IMG_9516.jpg" width="480" height="239" alt="Jars at Seattle Public Market" />**

**<img src="{static}/images/2011/04/IMG_9520.jpg" width="480" height="310" alt="Signs at Seattle Public Market" />**

And a couple of random closing shots:

<img src="{static}/images/2011/04/IMG_9466.jpg" width="480" height="205" alt="Over Lyre by Dan Senn (at Conservatory)" />

This is an acoustic sculpture at the conservatory. A speak is suspended against taught wires; inaudible music plays and vibrates the string - which in turn trigger instruments. A unique symphony ensues.

<img src="{static}/images/2011/04/IMG_9407.jpg" width="480" height="283" alt="Elliott Bay Bookstore" />

Elliott Bay Books is a must-visit for any reader. One of the best book stores I've ever been to.

A view of the city from the sculpture park.

And one more interesting thing. We drove back along the coast rather than the interstate. This takes you from Edison on up to Bellingham. This route is highly recommended (and most Vancouverites don't know about it).

Edison is a really pretty town with a harbour walk around it; the road between in and Bellingham hugs the coast with mountains on one side, cliffs on the other and forests everywhere. There are also lots of restaurants perched on those cliffs where you can grab a quick meal.
