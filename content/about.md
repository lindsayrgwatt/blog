If you're tuning into this blog you'll find that it serves a few purposes.

I'm fascinated by what happens at the margin of everyday life and tend to note it here (I have a belief that the most exciting stuff in the world happens at the edge).

I also use this blog to explore out loud and test undeveloped ideas (intellectual speculation).

Finally, I use it do document things that interest me, be it memories or a news story or something I might just want to remember some time in the future.

ps I used to have another blog. It's still [floating around the interpipes](http://lindsayrgwatt.com/archives/old_blog.html).
