Another surprising pleasure in Australia was their cafe culture.  The country is dotted with cafes and it's almost impossible to find a block without one.

The national coffee 'dish' is the [flat white](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_white).  It's like a latte but with less froth on the top (and good luck ordering one in NYC, except maybe at [Ruby's](http://www.rubyscafe.us/)).  The difference between a latte and a flat white [remains in dispute](http://coffeegeek.com/forums/worldregional/australasia/175181), but here's a photo of one from the Cafe Steyne in Manly:

As we explored the city we kept coming across different neighbourhoods with great cafes.  The ones in Glebe reminded me the most of the cafes I grew up with (Possibly because I grew up near a neighbourhood called Glebe - but a lifetime away from Sydney):

In the slightly more posh neighbourhood of Paddington, we found the funky bookstore/cafe [AllPress Espresso](http://www.allpressespresso.com.au/):

Nearby was the cafe [Lilifields](http://www.lilifields.com/index.html).  If you want to escape the city, it is the place to get a coffee.  It's located in a garden behind the shop and the only thing you'll hear is the sound of the water fountain:

If you leave Sydney you can still get great coffee.  We caffeinated ourselves on quite a few in Katoomba and  Mudgee:

And rest assured that it's not just a land for coffee (and dingo) lovers.  There's great tea too; the following comes from East Cost Coffee (don't hold their name against them):
