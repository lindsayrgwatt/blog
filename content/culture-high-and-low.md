It's been a busy week of culture here in New York.  On Monday, Wendy took me to the [Lincoln Center](http://www.lincolncenter.org/) to see *[La Traviata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_traviata)*:

The opera was great, although I must admit I was exhausted at the end.  I think it may have had something to do with the fact that Wendy had dragged me to *[The Duchess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_(film))* the night before.  Two period pieces in a row is quite exhausting.  Next time I'll go for Wagner.

Fortunately, it as the [Knicks](http://www.nba.com/knicks/) home opener against Miami on Wednesday night.  Scott and I went; here's the opening tip-off:

Remarkably good game; New York was up by over 15 but Miami closed it and almost took the game in the final minute.  Of note: this is the only town that boos its own players.  Both [Eddie Curry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Curry) and [Stephon Marbury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephon_Marbury) were booed during introductions.  Ironically, later on the crowd was cheering "We want Steph" (neither Curry or Marbury played; the coach has benched them both).
