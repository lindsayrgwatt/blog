There's a [fantastic article in Vanity Fair](http://m.vanityfair.com/society/2013/04/mysterious-residents-one-hyde-park-london) on One Hyde Park. It's the most expensive residential building on earth and a metaphor for a new London.

Here are some great quotes:

> “Knightsbridge is an un-English activity,” says York. “The former gratin \[upper crust\], a combination of old toffs, Knightsbridge Americans who wanted to be old toffs, plutocrats who wanted to know The Form, people who weren’t here for funny-money reasons: all those things have been completely obliterated by a mad kind of very, very gauche overseas money. It’s absentee money: the kind of money that has bodyguards. It is the world of Maybachs and absurd-looking Ferraris in absurd colors, and kids who buy them straight out of the shopwindow. These people have no substantive relationship with anything British at all. It’s everywhere: I can’t emphasize enough how everywhere-ish it is.”

> Many in London are uncomfortable not just with the flagrant display of super-wealth but also with the rising number of absentee residents who are based in foreign countries. “Those people who do buy these houses, particularly the bigger ones, in many cases don’t buy them to live in permanently: they are part of a portfolio,” said Bendixson. “That doesn’t add much jollity to your street: houses with the shutters down and nobody there.” Edward Davies-Gilbert, of the Knightsbridge Association, sees the area gaining the flavor of “a ghost town, peopled by ghost blocks.”

What I find interesting is that with many of the paragraphs you could substitute "London" with "Vancouver" and you'd have a similar story.
