When I was a kid in high school you used to hear whispers about a certain type of movie. Action movies. From Hong Kong. And they were unlike anything you could see in a pre-World Wide Web North America.

The granddaddy of all these was [The Killer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097202/) and as teenagers we scoured the video stores of Ottawa in search of it. I still remember seeing it and recognizing that this was a very different type of cinema than what was going on at the local Famous Players.

Fast forward 20 years: there are no more video stores, these movies still can't be found in iTunes but we're now in the wonderful world of YouTube.

And thus, here are links to a variety of classic HK movies that you absolutely need to watch.

Let's start with The Killer:

After that, it's on to my personal favourite, [Hard Boiled](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104684/), a classic of [Gun Fu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_fu). The opening scene in the tea shop is just incredible:

There's also the movie that started the [John Woo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Woo) & [Chow Yun Fat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_Yun-Fat) collaboration: [A Better Tomorrow](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092263/).

Now let's switch gears to some classic [Jackie Chan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Chan). For Chan, [Crime Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108656/) is a rare serious movie, based on the story of kidnapped executive [Teddy Wang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Wang) and with final scenes filmed in the emptied [Kowloon Walled City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City):
